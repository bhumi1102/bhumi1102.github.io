A place to write things down, about programming mostly.  Nothing about software is magic, though it appears that way sometimes.  When I get a chance, I pick a 'thread' to pull at, and this is one place to write down what I find.

Interesting thoughts from around the Inter Webs:

[About teaching Computer Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia55clAtdMs) - Focus on Ideas (as well as technology), create(as well a consume), write(as well as read), understand(as well as use), knowledge(not magic)

[Metathinking about Programming](http://confreaks.tv/videos/railsconf2017-keynote) - pausing and introspecting on how you act, feel, and think while you program.  When something goes well, think about what did you do, how did you feel, how did you think about it

[Long strange trip of a senior developer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egntf0nykzk&t=37s) - the idea of longitiviy in the sotware idustry, thinking of programmer's career is a 35 year span (instead of the 10-15 year stretch)
