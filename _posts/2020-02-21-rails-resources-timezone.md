Timezone:
https://github.com/kbaum/browser-timezone-rails - gem that set a cookie, pretty much what I did manually
Dated post about how that gem is implemented - http://cowjumpedoverthecommodore64.blogspot.com/2013/03/setting-rails-timezone-to-users.html
Railscast about Timezone from 

**JSTZ** - the library someone on IH mentioned in response to my question:
https://cdnjs.com/libraries/jstimezonedetect
unofficial fork npm - https://www.npmjs.com/package/jstz
Rails gem version of JSTZ - https://github.com/vanetten/jstz-rails

Good blog post narrative about bugs with timezone - https://medium.com/@jonathanabrams/be-aware-of-browsers-internationalization-api-db94bb32f9a8
