### Deploying, Migrating DB, Viewing Logs, Reading DB

**The errors and what I did to resolove then, in order of seeing them**

*Error* while doing Google login on https:

`ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid (PG::UndefinedTable: ERROR:  relation "identities" does not exist`
OH apparently DB tables have not been created yetâ€¦
Solvev by - did `heroku run rake db:migrate` and verified in heroku app dashboard that DB was created and had 9 tables

*Error* next one while trying to google login:

`ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid (PG::UndefinedColumn: ERROR:  column "2020-01-28" does not exist
2020-01-28T20:20:47.117922+00:00 app[web.1]: LINE 6:       AND dailies.date = "2020-01-28";`
Looks like the date format with double quotes is not liked by Postgres. I recall having to put it in for sqlite locally

Solved by: changing to single quotes (and verified by installing psql locally, connecting to heroku db by `heroku pg:psql` and testing it out, worked)

That's all the errors. sign-in with Google successful at https://healthspace.app I see the beautiful (to me) Dashboard with empty habit grid and 'add new habit' button and all that!

Also have done:
deploying (`git push heroku master`)
migrating db (`heroku run rake db:migrate`)
viewing logs (from broswer and also `heroku logs --tail`)
reading DB (`heroku pg:psql`)
