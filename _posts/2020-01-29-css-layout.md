**Flexbox** is a one-dimensional layout method for laying out items in rows or columns. Items flex to fill additional space and shrink to fit into smaller spaces.

This is an evolution from the way layout was done in limited and frustrating way - by float and positioning (static, relative, absolute, etc.)

**CSS Grid** on the other hand is more for two-dimentional layout. "CSS Grid Layout excels at dividing a page into major regions or defining the relationship in terms of size, position, and layer". 

This is an evolution of for layouts people did on top of HTML tables.

So Grid system seems more powerful than Flexbox and kind of a superset of Flexbox

This is what I get when I use **Bootstrap's default Grid System:**
>Use our powerful mobile-first flexbox grid to build layouts of all shapes and sizes thanks to a twelve column system, five default responsive tiers, Sass variables and mixins, and dozens of predefined classes

So this says it's based on Flexbox (but uses the word Grid so a little confusing).
