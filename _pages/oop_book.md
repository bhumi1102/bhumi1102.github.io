title:  "Master Object Oriented Programming"
---

to dispel self doubt. "I don't have a CS degree so I might be missing something". There is a baseline amount of "assumed knowledge". Terms get thrown around like idemponent, . No harm intended, it's like a shorthand. Come learn the shorthand so you never have to guess what someone is talking about.

After reading this book, you will feel condifent when you encounter the following concepts:

OOP terms:
- self
- super
- closure and scope
- class vs. module
- include/extend and mixins
- inheritance
- abstract class
- interface
- overloading
- overriding
- encapsulation
- public/private/protected
- object vs. class (OOP vs. prototypical inheritance)
- singleton class (ruby)

Not related to OOP, for "Pocket CS" book:
- recursion
- garbage collection, heaps
- caching
- threads and concurrency
- Big O and algorithms complexity 
- NP complete and traveling salesman problem
