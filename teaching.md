## Small Group Sessions [NEW]

I've been doing 1-on-1 long term mentoring for a few years. I've met weekly with 17 students over the last 3 years. I've been thinking about offering small group mentorship for a while, so that I can work with more students than I have time to meet individually. (btw, I have always found the word 'mentor' too grand and lofty. I prefer teacher, explainer, or guide.) 

One of my current students expressed interest in Computer Science fundamentals. He shared a tweet with me that said something like "Generative AI is here and there is no better to time to learn the fundamentals....and how things really work".

Anyway, I made this initial list of practical topics applicable to web developers (specifically Rails developers). We plan to dive into these topics over the next few months, so I decided this would be good way to invite others to join.

If you are looking to explore these topics/questions in depth, you can join me for small group mentoring sessions:

- Web protocols - HTTP, DNS, TCP/IP. The HTTP request/response cycle. How Rails processes incoming requests. What comes before the routes and controller actions? How web servers like puma work? What is Rack? What is middleware?
- Relational databases and SQL - ActiveRecord query methods. Which ones load results into memory and how that impacts performance.
- Object Oriented Programming concepts in Ruby 
- Dependency management - how RubyGems and Bundler work? What are Gemfile.lock and .ruby-version files for? What are gem native extensions?
- Programming languages, parsers, interpreters, compilers
- Operating systems, virtual machines, CPU and memory

The logistics - we will meet up to 4 times each month. We will also interact asyc (i.e. I'll send recorded explanations of questions from students). 
If I can assemble the right group, we will start in May, 2024.

Here's how you join: [interest form](https://forms.gle/2tXjwARgvvVNGHey5)

If you have any questions feel free to include them in the form too.

## 1-on-1 Sessions

If you're interested in 1-on-1 sessions, I do have 1 or 2 spots. Please email me at bhumi at theleafnode dot com. I typically start with a (free) intro chat and we see if it's a good fit from there.

Her technical expertise in Ruby, Ruby on Rails and programming and her experience in the industry is immediately evident to those fortunate enough to have the opportunity to receive mentorship. I would highly recommend that anyone who is interested in becoming a developer or furthering their skills in Ruby/ROR consider mentorship with Bhumi. They are sure to benefit from her knowledge and ability to explain difficult concepts in a manageable way. Bhumi, thank you for your guidance and help over the past several months!"
