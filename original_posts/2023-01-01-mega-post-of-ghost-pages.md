## My Narrative Story

(Write it for myself. Not for publishing. So I can be completely open)

Writing down a draft of my story, inspired by listening to this from the bootstrap founder.
- a setting in which the story unfolds,
- key characters that we want to relate to,
- a point of view from which itâ€™s told,
- a strong plot that drives the story,
- a comprehensive theme, and a lot of conflicts.

Setting - in Austin, TX moved right before the pandemic from the San Francisco Bay Area. I commuted to in the BART train from Walnut Creek CA (Because our 600 sq ft apartment at the top of pacific heights with a expansive views was not going to fit a baby). I started listening to podcasts for the very first time on the train 45 minutes twice a day. The very first podcast I ever heard was software engineering radio (I searched for "software engineering" in my podcast app and that's the one that showed up). From there I found Software Engineering Daily and then IndieHackers. I distinctly remember standing at the crowded platform of Embarcederro on my way home from work one evening and listening to an interview with someone named Courtland Allen on Software Engineering Daily. I remember Jeff asking why don't do a podcast? and I thought yes, that's what I thought when I saw the text-based interviews "if this was a podcast I could easily listen to it on my commute". And there was one, and IndieHackers podcast! This was end of 2016, maybe beginning of 2017. 
(What happened between 2017 and 2019. I had baby#2. I kept working. I kept communiting. I went to a conference in summer of 2017 and got the hint from people I met there that I should be on this thing called Twitter? I didn't really take that advice until end of 2019. I wanted to I think but couldn't figure out how to haha. still haven't. But despite having only ~500 followers, I did manage to figure out DMs and have made some internet friends that way and got the first contract client as well!).
In the summer of 2019 I quit my fulltime job as a software engineer. We also moved out of SF bay area for a number of reasons. One of them being to reduct our cost of living and monthly expenses so I could 'do my own thing'. At the end of 2022 I'm still figuring out what exactly that will be, long term. But I have started to earn $ again without having a fulltime job and maintaining flexibility of time. This is with Ruby/Rails contracting work (aka freelancing). I am trading time for money. My goal in 2019 was to move away from exactly that. But this makes sense right now. And also feels good to get money coming in the bank account. It makes me feel unstuck. In terms of living life and feeling free to spend money on fun, non-essential things. So that is progress. A huge progress for me. Having always been a fulltime employee and having no concept of freelancing, contracting, consulting and the logistics of how to get into that. I figured it out! I tried in 2021, by creating a profile on upwork and had some back and forth conversations there but that didn't go anywhere. The quality of the people reaching out was not very high and I didn't sense a good fit so I didn't pursue it much. One whole year later, I got something going! (actually 2 things).

## CodeCurious Business Game Plan

February 1, 2022
Here are the things I need to successfully build a business around tech content/education.
Friends/Co-workers
I feel that I need to keep talking to other people and continue the work of building a support network. I two indie friends so far - Trey and Hrishi. In order to find more, I think I need to get clear on qualities I want in those friends and then look accordingly. Here's what comes to mind:
Someone I can talk about the logistics on building a tech education/content business (so more friends like Trey). Ideal role model = Chris Oliver
Someone who is further along than me and already running a profitable successful business (Sass or content) who is happy to teach and share. So like a mentor. Ideal setup = Michele Hansen is to Colleen or at least what it appears to be from the pod. Richa could be this.
Rails developer friends to share my writing with and get their honest feedback. People who I know enough and who know me enough so I can trust their feedback. Maybe I'll make some in the wnb.rb community, hopefully! OR Rails developer friends I can pair with - like if I'm debugging some issue or I can be a good sounding board if they need for debugging. (Hrishi can be this type of friend, though we've talked biz stuff not Rails/dev stuff so far).
Local friends that I can meetup with for coffee or lunch would be nice eventually. Though all the above friends could be virtual too for now. 
Timing/Frequency - Mentor friend I'd like to talk to every week or at least every 2 weeks. Tech educator friend I'd like to have the ability to reach couple times a week or whevener I decision/question arises that I want to talk through. Rails dev friends, I'd like to send my content over for feedback on a rolling basis, probably once a week or so.
What actions am I taking to make this happen?
Joined wnb.rb, will participate in the book club
Keep talking to Trey on Fridays - have updates for him of what I did and also tactical questions 
Send Hrishi my writing. Interview him about Rails history. Maybe offer to pair on his rails app debug work. (sense a lack of enthusiam so not sure if any of that will work out)
For biz mentors - find reasons to meet with Richa again and also Z from WC.
Once I have enough content on cc.dev or something good to share, reach out to Chris Oliver for feedback or for advice on how to work towards membership site. (when it feels natural, 3 to 6 months from now probably) I would like to launch membership option by Nov. 1, 2022.
Establish my Technical Reputation
I need to brainstorm on how to go about doing this? What is the most direct way? How do I do something every day, every week towards this? 
I can put out content/tweets (about what? still a skill to learn on it's on right)
DM people who already have a reputation, and have them checkout my content and ask for feedback or to include in their newsletter
grow number of cc.dev visitors and email list subscribers (then say "CodeCurious has 2000 users and 5000 readers weekly readers" that establishes authority)
Embrace the Founder Title
I want to make CodeCurious an official business. And I want to get comfortable introducing myself as 'Bhumi Shah, Founder of CodeCurious' or answer 'what do you do?' with "I'm a software engineer. Currently I'm building my own business called CodeCurious. We produce technical content for web developers with a focus on Ruby on Rails, but also includes JavaScript and core web technologies and software development in general' I create tutorials, blogposts, videos and screencasts. I do long-term 1-on-1 mentoring. I wrote an ebook. We have interviews with experienced Rails developers.

Brainstorm - questions for backtorails.com developer interviews
Hrishi (yes)
Intro - founder of Learnetto, Rails contractor for the last 13 years
When did you start Learnetto and has it always been a Rails app?
What version of Rails did Learnetto start on, and what has it been like upgrading the versions over the years? And maintaining the Rails app in general?
Are you using any other tech alongside Rails and what's been your experience like integrating other tech with Rails?
What has it been like doing Rails contracting over the years? Any stories or patterns you're seen from the various applications you've come across? 
You made a course teaching React and Rails. What is your process for teaching and creating a ?  
What do you think of Hotwire and the build changes around Rails 7?
You have a brand new Rails course in the works? What will that cover?
Colleen S. (???)
Intro - Rails consultant for X year, made a SaaS product called SimpleFileUpload 
Brian Jensen (???)
Rails in the backend, as an API only, with a VueJS frontend I think. Long running business.
My intro for backtorails.com - write down my rails history. Then call myself the founder of CodeCurious.dev - articles, tutorial, cheatsheets for intermediate/advace software developers. With a focus on Rails but includes core web technologies and general programming and software industry topics as well.

Working backwards action items:
In two weeks I want to invite interviewees --> In that invite I want to sign as founder, codecurious.dev. (I need a tagline too) --> When clicked I want that website to have legit content (that I can create in the next 5 to 6 days). 
All that is in my control. not in my control - I want to be able to say "read by over 1000 developers". Two things I can do to influence that 1. choose topics that people are searching for, content that is inheriently useful. ebomb vibe 2. distribute in all the places.
The 'distribute' part I am not worried about. I know what to do. I know the places. It'll be a lot of posting work. Time is all that's needed.
But I am not sure about what to create. That's what I need to work out! (That is what my brain feels stuck on, that's why I begin writing in the first place. To move to action and away from analysis.). So here are my ideas!
Super practical, short how-to: for example how-to install redis, how to use pg command line
Cheatsheets: for git commands, for psql command line, for sublime shortcuts (need to develop these in my day-to-day activity still)
Definitions for terms: bikeshedding, paradigm, (need to build this list over time, when I read and listen to pods, write these down)
My philosophies / editorial style - on code reviews, debugging, meta-thinking while programming feelings/thoughts/actions. (not as interesting to others unless they know my tech stuff first. So write down now, but publish later).
Long-form posts - what is hotwire/turbo/stimulus with code examples. with real working code checked-in to my GitHub.
Ah ha - review what I have already written on dev.to or for TLN and post relevant things to cc.dev ("how to write effectively, code review etiquette, etc.)
Rails components deep dive - build a fresh app to learn and demonstrate how to use a component. For example ActionMailbox (extracted from hey.com), sounds cool!
Programming books - read and share takeaways, insights from those. Example wnb.rb bookclub, also the Rails4 Jose Vallim book on rails engines and other Rails internals. 
Audio explanation - job-to-be-done = learn something conceptual while on commute
Student questions - keep track of answers I found, can include non-rails stuff too. example "How to get a variable from a file to another file in Node.js" from Tanisha

February 2, 2022
Next level from the above. So I need to have a website at codecurious.dev that I can link to everywhere I introduce myself (and call myself the 'founder' of). I need that website to be able to host all 8 types of content I enumerated above. 
Decision point - Ghost or something else? And if Ghost, self-hosted or paid?
Answer - going with Ghost. Why? It meets my requirements for being able to host the type of content I want to host. 
#4 to #8 is text and I can host it naturally as 'posts'. I can easily embed videos for screencasts, I can add images or screenshots of terminal and such and I can add code snippets with syntax highlighting. I have the ability to add html snippets too for custom styling if I want.
I can also write always in markdown (so I can have the option to export). I can have my posts written in markdown and checked-in to my Github repo and then copy/paste into Ghost to post. I can do this workflow for long posts with lot of code that I want to save in version control OR I can have back-up of all my posts. I could use Ghost editor or I could use Obsidiun or any other markdown editor I want.
#1 and #2 limitation - The cheatsheets or infographics (that I'd make in Canva) I can either add as an header image of a post or I can make them text based in HTML (for search engines). Maybe a limitation. Ideally I want a grid of cards that are browsable and searchable/filterable for this (sort of like marketing examples). Save everything I make in a repo and I can always make a little Rails site and link to it in the Nav.  
#3 definitions of terms - this could just be a page that I keep updating and link to in the header navigation. I guess eventually I'd like to make it fancier and have a search. But yeah all on one page and user can cmd+f would be just fine. It would be cool to make this SEO descoverable with definition showing up in the snippet
Decision part 2 is self-hosted. Why? To avoid restriction and because I already have experience self-hosting personal blog for 2 years now.
The $9 paid has restriction around custom themes and custom integrations. And 500 members. I'd like to be able to buy that theme that has GhostHunter search integration for $49 potentially. And I'd definitely like to do custom zapier integration with Github or with Mailchimp and such. I also would like to have the ability to add more than 1000 members without paying an arm and a leg (like $200). I am assuming for self-hosted there is not restriction on number of members. (have not tried this out though). 
The main downside is that I have upgrade to new versions of Ghost manually. That's fine I guess, I can upgrade TLN first to test it out OR I can just stay on the older version if I don't need new features (though I might if I start offering memberships as that's still being built out).
Decision made to now action can continue:
1. Write/edit and post my Stimulus and Turbo posts to TLN (Stimulus on Thursday, Turbo on Friday?) 
2. Setup the Digital Ocean droplet pointing to codecurious.dev and we're in business. Then copy over the two posts.
3. Write an "about me" or intro post - what is this? who am I?
4. Add analytics to for 'number of reader' metric. Add email list integration from Mailchimp at the bottom of each post and in the header.
5. Intro myself in wnb.rb group. update twiter. ask WC to follow cc_dev twitter.
Things I am not doing:
no newsletter yet, no membership subscriptions yet. Blog with lots of consistent posting, search engine discoverable. Goal is to have cc.dev show up in search results for relevant questions like "what is hotwire" in the next 6 months (in the meantime, manually distribute to all the places). 
Gradual plan - all content not-gated. Once enough visitors (1000) then gate content, require free sign-up. Once enough free (5000?) then add paid membership option. OR do none of that. Have to eventually make money but stay open. It could be via sponsorship or some other way I cannot think of write now. Opportunities will arise once I have resonnance. Create stuff that resonates, adds value, makes people coming back. Keep repeating until this staement is true "codecurious is super useful when I want to really understand something deeply. Or when I want to learn a little tidbit on a 5 mintue break. Or look up exactly how to do something"
Content plan - once enough content of the above 10 type. Add newsletter. Add podcast. Add community. Add meetups of cc members. Hm..okay stop this in-the-cloud future thinking Bhumi, stay in the present. Oh and add a job board (! definitely $ there).

## Daily 42 Jobs To Be Done

First time I heard this phrase was in a book I read on customer interviews (Deploy Empath). It is a framework for how to think about innovation growth for business executives entrepreneurs. The main idea is that people don't buy products as much as they hire products to do a job, to make progress in their life under a specific circumstance. 
I learned all this by reading (well, listening so far) to a book called Competing Against Luck. A book I almost did not hire, based on the first chapter. It sounded super corporate and generic, used the word innovation 87 times (probably not too far off though I didn't count!). Boring. But glad I kept listening because it gets better, much better. The reason I kept listinening is because of how I came across this book in the first place. It was recommended by one of my indie hacking role model, in an interview from couple years ago.

## Daily 41 Covid Confessions

Did not eat out or pick up food from restaurants from march 2020 to May 2021 (after getting vaccinated). Did not send children to in person school from March 2020 to November 2021 (minus a brief failed experiment in June/July, backed off in August due to Delta). Had zoom school and home school option, although much scaled back in the last 6 months. 
Have not seen my parents and sister since December of 2019. (who live a 3 hour flight away). Mostly due to Covid but also due to the fact that we have a immuno comprised family member and didn't want to make logistics complicated. 
Over these first few weeks of 2022 starting to unpause life. restart life? Still in transition, still mentally adjusting, still concerned overall.
I have not been on a plane since December of 2019. Longest in my life. I have been on planes at least half a dozen times every year since college.

## Daily 40 My Shopify Saga

Where I thought I wanted to make a Shopify app, that is super utilitarian and no brainer buy. I'll put it in the Shopify app star, get instance distribution, and customers. Make a million dollar SaaS that way. And done! Then I talked to peoople and learned stuff. Also interviewed at Govalo, a gift card app that the internet famous person Kelly something co-founded. They did a no-show and then Kelly quit, etc.

## Daily ? Pain and Discomfort

I was trying to avoid suffering. Avoid suffering form avoidable mistakes. By researching and planning and learning as much as I could. 
Every single person has had this thought:
If I tweet this and no one 'likes' it, it'll feel bad
If I publish this writing, and no one reads it,it'll feel bad.
If I build this and no one uses it, it'll feel bad.
Stoic execution. What does that mean? Highs not too high, lows not too low.
I am sitting in the comfort of my own home, using my fingers to hit little buttons in front of a glowing screen. I am in no danger. physical or otherwise.
Manifestation is success. Putting something out in the universe is a success.
Only obligation is to accurately represent and articulate your internal world. Get good at matching, without holding back.

Soccer Shots motto: rule #2 try your best rule #3 believe in yourself. And rule #1 which I thought was not applicable in this case 'listen to your coach'. In this case, talk to other people, make friends and that can be your collective 'coach'. 
Commitment. Faith. Talk to people.
As an entrepreneur you're never going to be 'sitting pretty'. I recall hearing and using this phrase in college around final exams time. Different people have different time slots for their classes. Some people have an exam on the very last day. You may finish your exams in the first week and then be sitting pretty. 
As an active operator of a business you're never going to be 'sitting pretty'. Never going to feel like you're in a good, safe, comfortable place. (that's what I see as the definition on the internet [attach screenshot]).
I am speculating here - if you've had some 'exit' you may be sitting pretty for good. Until you start your next thing. You may have all the negative feelings but you know how to channel them. You're more confident, more self-assured. Maybe. (maybe it's like having a 2nd child. having all the same experiences but without the complete and utter panicking)

RX - reading experience. My goal in getting better at writing is to get better at telling stories and making my writing easy and appealing to read.

## Daily ? The Prep Year

When cooking, you do many things before the actual act of applying heat to ingredients (on the stove, in the oven). You decide what to make, you research how to go about making it, you collect ingredients (you have to spend time or money, either growing or buying these). Then you chop and get everything in place. Up until now you have no meal that you can eat or serve. Up until now there is not much visible progress.
2021 feels like a prep year. There are people who have cooked many meals and gone through the whole process multiple times. A founder. A founder of what? I don't think that's imposter syndrome or anything. It's the objective truth. I should feel hesitant with the label 'founder' as I am not a founder of any (one) thing (yet!).

--

## Daily ? Visualization

Something to read if I need a reminder of my 'north star' 
Other than the 4M (which is on hold in favor of some validating MRR), what else am I working towards?
biz experience for teaching purposes - so I can help other engineers transition to doing their own thing, starting their own indie businesses and living life on their own terms (instead of getting stuck in the engineering/managerial career ladders, or getting burned out and leaving the industry. especially minorities, especially parents. ex: shika, shruti, hoiyee?, sherley? salas) Show that there is a better way, I've done it and you can too. 
street cred - so I can be part of and influence important conversations. All the way up to GT, MFM pod, celebrities like Hasan. Conversations in Software, tech, startup. But also gender/parenting stuff with tech.
street cred to connect with other founders and my kinda people.

--

## Daily ? Fears

What am I afraid of? List the things so to make them less potent:
I am too different and people won't get it. It's not an expected story. (for example, damen with his backstory of "I'm an employee trying to breakout of the corporate chain. I am dad providing for my kid's daycare and help my wife so she doesn't have to work, etc." People expect and support such stories.
I will have to change too much, in my mindset and thinking, in order to be successfull at marketing and personal branding things. 
There will a lot of pain and disappointment. Yeah there will be. I can take it. I can be tough. It's nothing compared to how strong mom has been at this age in her life. Yeah please. 

--

## Daily Podcasting is the perfect endgame?

And observation I have. 
Barack Obama's podcast
My First Million - two friends, who have "made it" and excuse to talk to each other and do what they enjoy. And excuse to talk to interesting people by inviting them on the show.
Software Social pod - two friends with an excuse to talk to each other
What else is the point of life if not to connect with fellow earthlings who share this planet at this particular point in space and time.

## Daily Something Worth Doing is Worth Doing Poorly

I read this on Twitter. And I immediately added 'at first' at the end of that sentence in my head. Worth doing poorly, at first right? because we all know something worth doing is worth doing well. I am of course thinking about teaching content, especially recorded content (e.g. screencasts). 
There is so much tech content out there, tutorials, blog posts on every language, framework, and tool. Why create more? Lot of it is not very good. I stopped reading tech blog posts and prefer to go to the source material (the docs) when I learning something new. But that takes time to parse through. I figured I can create content 
It needs to be clear, and concise. And it needs to make sense to an absolute beginner. And I need to have speak clearly and confidently and slowly and stop saying 'umm' just pause instead. 
I stopped recording as I wasn't sure if it was useful to anyone. With broadcast content like that it's hard to setup a feedback loop. The other reason I stopped is because I gave into the Resistance. The feeling of doing something badly, but still doing it is so painful. Especially when you can see it needs to be so much better, it can be so much better and there is so much distance to travel from here to there. I allow myself to get overwhelmed.
I recorded 15 screencasts earlier this year. And I recorded a short podcast of me talking to myself. They are all cringe-worthy. But I am proud of myself of having it done it. Not only I created those things, I shared them openly (sent out emails to CodeCurious list and shared it in WeekendClub). Those are steps in the right direction. How do I keep building on that?
I want to get better at talking and recording myself and hearing my recorded (this is needed in my future ATFM

## Daily Dear Recruiter Email

When I get a recruiter email, it often lacks answers to many questions I would want to know before even remotely thinking about engaging.
If I even decide to join another company (as an employee/contractor), here are the things to I'd want to know about their engineering team:
I want to know about people, process, and culture
People
I want to work with people who are very smart, talented, etc. But also who are level-headed and down-to-earth. And people who have a sense of humor, who don't take themselves too seriously. I've had this in my most recent team. Not too much to ask right.
Process
I mean engineering process. Basic software development hygiene that allows the team to work on actual problems and not be swasting time solving problems of their own making due to lack of good habits and some discipline. (I'd be weary of too much process as well and the tendency of "management" to over-react anytime something goes by adding more steps/buarecracy. This is likely a problem with larger more establish teams. Startups with smaller teams have the opposite problem usually, growing pains as everyone is doing things by the seat of their pants initially.)
(such as someone accidentally merging the wrong branch to main or running a query on a prod database or finding simple bugs after the release due to lack of testing, etc.)
Culture 
This is about how people deal with egos and feelings and all the other messy parts of being a human that sometimes stand in the way of reason and logic. I want to know if the team generally has emotionally mature people who feel secure in themselves. Some examples of how I can access this:
When something goes wrong, what is the first reaction? Is it about 'who' or 'what', 'why' and 'how'. The default culture could be to look to blame and "who made what change that broke this?" OR the culture could be about saying "first, let's focus on figuring out why this broke? What is the best way to fix the immediate issue? What can we do to prevent or detect this sooner in the future?" 
If someone makes a mistake is the default instint to hide or to come clean and acknowledge? If the culature is to not look to blame first, the 'who' should immediately feel the urge to share what they did that was a mistake and be closely involved in fixing.
There is a lot more to culture but the above is the basic minimum, people not feeling like they have to be walking on eggshells at work.
Some onboarding

## Daily Courage and Doing Brave Things

I had an appointment with a flabatomist this morning for some routine labwork. I was feeling a little nervous as I was getting ready to go there. I am not a fan of needles and I was tiny veins and they're not able to find it the first time. And I was fasting so was a little hungry. And I forgot my water bottle at home so I didn't have anything to drink if I felt a little woozy afterwards. 
All in all small things. Not a big deal at all. Routine stuff. Not like I'm donatinga  kidney or something. There are bigger more important things to feel nervous about, definitely. (But I felt nervous about this. I even thought about canceling. This was in the important-but-not-urgent category so I could have). 
An interesting thing happened though. I was feeling nervous beforehand. But I felt brave afterwards. Brave to the point that it made me want to do other brave things. Like more consequentail brave things. Things that most people feel nervous about like giving meetup talks and recording podcast interviews. It's interesting how that works. My brain likes this feeling of going through with something (important/meaningful) despite feeling nervous.
This reminds me to something related I read "courage is going from failure to failure without lossing enthusium". The failure could be a real complete failure or it could be an undesirable outcome. Or it could be a smaller success (in numbers) than you were expecting. The without loosing enthusium seems to me the important part. Because when you are brave I imagine things don't actually work out 100% of the time. Sometimes your fears do come to pass. They could've taken a while to find my veins, could've given me a bruse that took multiple weeks to heal. I could've fainted or felt too out of it to drive myself back home. None of that happened this time but it could have.
For the work things that are in the important-but-not-urgent category some form of courage is what is required to get over my mild but pesistent hesitation. All of these things have to do with talking to people, networking as it's called. I will record my daily dev log and make it public on the codecurious channel. I will interview other developers and share those. I will record audio versions of my conceptual posts and share those. I will pitch to be a guest on other podcasts (once I have enough content on cc.dev to feel legitimate referring to myself as "founder, codecurious"). I will go to in-person local meetups. And I will go to Railsconf. And I will actually talk to people and make friends.

## Daily How I am different from Other People

These are things that are good to keep in mind when consuming other people's business stories and advice.
I do not have workoholic tendencies. I do not automatically work at nights, on weekends. In fact, while being full-time employed I got good at drawing boundaries and keeping work (email/slack) out of 'my time'. Do I want to change this? Do I need to change this? Well, let's consistently work 35 hours per week first (so all 7 hours the kids are at school I need to work work mode, doing traction, deep work, GTD). After that, I can starting workin 1 hour at night and 1 hour in the morning consistently. Also talking to other founders counts as work. Reading and taking notes on biz book for indie book notes counts too. 
I want to be present with R and C and also do projects for their benefit and introduce them to experiences and activities and teach them things and help them get into things (biking, swimming, reading books, art/craft projects like tie die, playing flute, juggling. kitchen projects. also chores and things). This takes time, during weekends, and during weekday evenings. (I don't think M will take the lead of this stuff as it's not about the basics and making sure they are okay enough. this is extra stuff, optional stuff).
I also want to have a life that involves exploring. Just exploring for the sake of it. locally going to different places and trying different foods. And also going to various national parks, learning how to camp on our own (or make friends with other camping families). Rent an RV and try that out. Travel within this country but also travel internationally. I want kids to have memories of outdoors, nature. (costs money). This takes time to plan and make happen, and also money (as I don't think M will take the lead on it automatically.)
parents, I have a responsibility towards my parents (because I like them and they have sacrificed a lot and I owe them). This costs me time, to do errands on their behalf (e.g figuring out all of medicare stuff, presciptions, doc appointments, other stuff there is always something many things).  More than time this cause stress and anxiety and worry. A constant worry about when something's gonna go down that will. They are only getting older and for the next 20 to 30 years or however long they live this will be the case. I went them to thrieve and not just survive. I want to them to be health, do things, have hobbies, spend their time by keeping physically and mentally active. Not be lonely. Find other purpose as Is. is getting older and will go to school and taking care of him and helping D. won't be a constant necessity. (Could I employ them someone in some sort of business endevour I do?...maybe in the next 3 to 4 years after CodeCurious is established, I can keep that in mind).
sister, many things have changed in the last 2 years in her life. She has a husband with a cronic condition which he'll have for the rest of his life. He is okay now and will start to work even. But anything can go wrong at any time, for his health. This implies health insurance will always be needed and jobs will always be needed. Will never be 'sitting pretty' worrifree, all good. (I thought I could 'help create peace of mind' for everyone at least financially by making the 4 to 5M and then have D not worry about health insurance at least and P&M also not worry about bills medicare doesn't cover and their living expenses. But that was too much pressure to put on my journey at this point).
How does that make me different than other founders? My being close to parents and sisters and caring about their overall well-being and worrying about what's going on in their life day-to-day does affect my time as well as mental space. Sometimes negatively, where I freeze and am not able to make forward progress on my business things (e.g in August after the whole unpleasantness with D ignoring me after telling P to tell me to take care of his presciption refill with Sanjeev. I have to admit how majorly that negatively effected me.) 
What can I do about all this family worries and attachments - prey daily for everyone's wellbeing. And also allocate time when I do P&M things, evenings or weekends when possible. Protect te 7 hours --> 35 hours minimum! 
Things that other people may care about that I don't - buying fancy cars like a tesla, or buying a beach house in california. Don't care for all that. Other problems I don't have - childhood that requires you to see mental health professional regulary. Needing to find someone, that is one all-consuming project that I've graduated from in life. Need to just keep putting in the work, time, communication needed to maintain a marriage indefinitely. 
Overall insight - All the other family and kids and life stuff evens out (in comparing to other people. Other people's week might not get thrown off by having to order presicption and make blood test appointment for their parents. But they may also not have the unconditional love and support of people who raised them so yeah. A lot of entrepreneurs don't really talk about their parents). The key takeaway from this writing exercise is that raw hours put in to business matters. Other successful people just put it more raw hours than I do (or have been able to in the last 2 years, but in general I don't ever recall working hard for 40 hours straight while employed). Raw hours counts, and making every single one of those hours count, doing 'deep' work, setting it up for traction. working on one thing. It matters, it really matters. Doing actual work or enough number of hours each week or long enough, couple years! 
Also I need to make it so that people around me know I am taking my business seriously (mainly M and also M's parents if they come to visit). What signals would communicate that I'm not 'free' or I can't just 'take the week off', 'oh don't work bhumi'. Yeah! I am bothered by these assumptions and comments for good reason. So how do I solve this? What things imply serious company, Bhumi is busy running her business, she has responsibilites and her time is not 'free'. Maybe incorporate CC, LLC. File taxes seperately. Hm..maybe. Send 'investor update' type emails to family members about the work I have put out. Blog posts, YT videos, etc. Also communicate what I am trying to do, this is tricky as I don't actually want to get ahead of myself or make plans too far into the future. I want to say what I have already done. Also the content business is trickier to explain vs. a software business. Too early, but I do wan to be in a position to do communicate this kinda stuff to parents, M's parents, D and Payal in the next 2 months time (end of Q1). 
My own mindset - what does it mean to take it seriously (also I don't want to be afraid of making plans and being aggressive anymore. flip that switch from covid days. Yes stuff can happen, kids can get sick, we can get sick, family can have problems but that's no way to live, in worry. When stuff happens I will adjust, otherwise push forward!).  Treat it like a real business vs. projects or experienment I'm doing. One thing is to have customers or other partners, stakeholders. Make it like a real job - find and communicate equivalence for boss, co-workers, meetings, deadlines, milestones, release calendar, commiting/shipping.
schedule meetings with potential customers and partners daily - to get feedback from other developers or informal chat with developers about Rails or how they do things and learn things in general.
for deadlines - have a publishing calendar and tell people in WC about it and stick to it and share every time a publish blog posts or videos in WC. keep it sustainable but 2x per week at least!
