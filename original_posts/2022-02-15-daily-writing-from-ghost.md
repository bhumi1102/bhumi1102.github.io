## Daily 44 A Few Issues I have with Programming

https://twitter.com/rbates/status/1482593057086214144

"One of the few issues I have with web development is that our work is never complete. There is satisfaction in calling something “done”." Ryan Bates Tweet, Jan 15, 2022

I have thought about this before. And there are a few issues I have with programming.
What Ryan said is definitely one of them. The fact that it's never done. No feature, no product, no project, no codebase is truly done. Assuming it has users that is (and that includes having a single user which is you). If the code has no users, then it is abandoned. Yet not done.
The other issue I have with web development and programming in general is that there is no perfection to be had. Few years ago, I was reading a book about pizza (American Pie was the title I think) and towards the end a pizzaiolo describes the experience of making 100 pies of pizza in the same kitchen. Then reveling in the fact that he has made the perfect pie of pizza for his 101st.
I distinctly recall sitting back thinking to myself "I will never have that type of satisfaction in my profession". There are no 100 programs you can write (or N years of experience under your belt) after which you will be write programs, sit back and think 'now that is a perfect program'. Followed by a chef's kiss*.
I used to eat at a pizza place in San Francisco whose motto was 'Respect the Craft'. It was printed on the pizza boxes, the owner even had it tattooed on his arms I think. We use this word 'craft' with writing software too. But it is not a craft that one can master in the same way one can master bread making or woodworking or cheese making or any number of things in the analog world. The digital equivalent is different. 
And last issue I have with programming is time unpredictability. For example I know if I spend an hour writing I will have something to publish and share at the end. There is satisfaction in that. This is not true for programming. Especially debugging. We can't predict how long something will take most of the time. (And breaking it up into several different time blocks across multiple days is not always an option. You need that continuity to really make progress.)
[If it's never done and perfection is not the aim then where should we get our satisfaction from? [Or should we abandon such pursuits and accept the Buddhist truth that unsatisfactoriness is pervasive and that life is suffering (cue 'I can't get to satisfaction')] 
I think there are ways to get satisfaction from programming and creating software, albeit slightly indirectly. Not one but two ways. 
One of them is teaching.
The other is entrepreneurship. 
When I hear respect the craft, I think of people like Ryan Bates from 10 years ago and Chris Oliver of GoRails and many many others. I can't help but be inspired to give back, to pay it forward. Join me.
I bought a new domain (backtorails.com) a few weeks ago on a whim. I see Ryan Bates started]

## Daily 43 3 IndieHacking Tips

That I would give to my past self. 
Small steps count. Slow is okay. Slow and steady. When in doubt, do something. Eexternally visible sharable thing. Action (not only motion). Don't draft, publish. Don't plan, share/ship. 
One thing for a long time. How? Go with what interests you. What you have enthusiasm for. What you can imagine doing for a long time. Like a long time, years not months. (because it takes longer than it looks). 
Get used to feeling uncomfortable. Pain, suffering, discomfortable, fear of rejection/failure. It's all part of it. Don't avoid it, don't try to 'protect' yourself from it. Go toward it, face it, embrace it. go through it. (you will always be sitting in the comfort of your own home, typing while looking at a screen. come'on. It's not actually scary)
Bonus: talk to other people who are also on this journey and make friends. Seriously. Talk to people. 
This last thing is what I truely wish someone has told me 2 years ago. Because talking to other people is what actually helped solidify the other lessons. Still working to internalize this but feel very confident that these are the right things for me to internalize at my stage in the journey.

## Daily 40 My History with Rails

I started drafting some posts for CodeCurious today. While looking at Rails7 and what's new, important maps stick out. So I started digging into import maps and how they work. Why is this special? Why is this possible now, why wasn't it before? (of course DHH has written about it and I've read all of those leading up to Rails7 launch and starting from NEW MAGIC but I am still left with loads of curiosity and an urge to dig deeper). What I really want to do is explore Rails history with Javascript  – ending at import maps. But starting from turbolinks, pjax? I don't know yet where it'll start. I am pulling at this thread and digging into it, writing down everything I learn.
Before I even do that, how about I write down my history with Rails. I just purchased a domain backtorails.com. I haven't been doing Rails in production in the last 4 years at least. For tiny personal projects it's the my go to framework but that is all.
So I learned Ruby on Rails in 2012. I had decided to transition to web development that previous year. Until then I was doing firmware engineering embedded C and some C++ for implanted medical devices. So not software but I was writing firmware. I taught myself Rails along with Ruby and HTML5/CSS3/JS and MySQL and Heroku within a couple months. It was not more intellectually challenging but it was very different. (I don't want to make it seem like I taught myself programming and got a job all within 6 months. I knew programming and computer science already. It is web stuff I didn't know. For example I had never used a database or written a SQL query in my med device world.)
[thought/hesitation - I don't want people to assume or conclude that I know more than I do. Or that I've a lot of hands-on coding than I actually have. My 15 years of experience sounds like a lot but it is not on one thing. I do feel like a jack of all trades but master of none. The mastery, the deep expertise is something I value and desire but don't feel that I have yet. Of course, confidence and evolved mindset I do have. I know and believe that I can figure out anything having to do with programming. With enough time. I am not fast. and I don't want to be. I like slow coding. Taking my time to understand and explore and not just make the thing work. Although I can make it work fast when needed. Though it's less satisfying]
I used Rails versions 2, 3, and 4 from 2012 to 2016. Then it was Java, Spring Boot and Microservices. Then it was Rails again briefly whilte integrating with Jiff's codebase. Then Kafka.
Then back to Rails for habit tracker. That was before webpacker and as a result npm and node were required to build a rails project?

## Daily 39 Studying other entrepreneurs

This one is about a teacher entrepreneur named Harry Dry of Marketing Examples. I like studying other indie businesses and their founders. I noticed I've been doing this subconsciously over the last couple years. I am curious about how things evolve in their businesses over a longer period of time. With the idea of teasing out lessons and data points and learning from their experience. 
One of them is Harry Dry of Marketing Examples. I've been on his email list for a while. Things have been quiet until today. He sent an email announcing a free copywriting website, a swipe file. I first came across his work from the IndieHacker's podcast, must have been. Then much later saw that he was involved in WeekendClub as well, sort of.
(I have not directly spoken to most of these people I study. These are observations from a distance and I make some assumptions as well, which could be way off).
I recall that he announced marketing course last year, spring or summer of 2021 I think. He collected emails but not payments and I don't recall too much detail other than the fact it was a nicely designed unique looking landing page. According to the landing page the course was suppose to be ready in fall of 2021. I haven't seen any communication around that, I assumed it's just taking longer than expected (as it goes with making a course. Making any course is hard. Making a good course is really hard, where you care about having it be all awesome and 'epic' and a masterpiece.) 
Aside: If you're a teacher at heart you care too much about the pedagogical aspects of the thing. Making it be cohesive and making it flow and the whole thing is more than just recording the individual lessons. You're better off having the mindset that "I'm gonna do it in a quick and dirty way" for your first course. At least that's how I know I'll need to approach it. Otherwise it'll never get done, never even get started by me!
Back to Harry of Marketing Examples. He's gotta an audience. Like real fans and supporters who are ready to buy from him. 100k+ followers on Twitter, close to that on his email list. People know him, he has trust and credibility. I've heard his name mentioned on a few podcasts randomly with people being impressed by his work. He's been on IndieHacker podcast, he's well regarded in the indie community. And he has provided a lot of value already in terms of free content. 
Given all this, I'm eager to see how this new thing fares for him. By that I mean the copywriting course. I hope it works out for him. Financially. (because if not, what hope is there for the rest of us wanna be teache-preneurs hah). He is young, like in his 20s I think. So he's got time to experiment and try different things either way. 
This move from a 'marketing course' to 'copywriting course' is a good one, it seems to me. There is no such skill as 'business' and I think similar reasoning applies to learning 'marketing'. That's too broad. I will teach you copywriting is much more concrete and specific. And there is already a business, that I've studied, focused on teaching copywriting, been around for more than a decade and it's owner is financially independent (age ~40 I think).  So there is some data points there.

## Daily 38 Talking to other people

Talking to people causes disturbances in the calm waters of our mind. At least for introverted people. It takes energy (to process), as opposed to giving us energy. Not in a bad way. Often in an important way that makes you productively think or reflect. Hopefully. With the right types of people.
One of the ways it disturbs my calm waters is that it energies and inspires me to the point of creating a desire to do more things faster (than I can time realistically do).
I tried that mode and it hasn't worked for me. Do all the things, many things at once, jump between things. That's no good for me. My current theme this year is less things / small steps / slow but steady. 
So the below is a pep talk to myself to stay the course, while continuing to have conversations and make friends in the indie world (maybe I shall read it as a reminder after future chats).
Here it goes:
We all know that you've gotta walk before you run. And you need to crawl before you walk. Even before that, you need to be able to sit up for a long period of time without getting wobbly or falling over (people who are parents may have a clear picture of their infant doing that). For tiny humans this process takes 6 to 9 months – from sitting up to walking. That's a long time, it's more than 1/2 their life.
When we look around in the indie world, there are so many examples of people at the a walking and running stage. Because these are the impressive stages or at least more visible stages (where you can be interviewed on podcasts and have public conversations on Twitter about your experience running a SaaS). And all of those stories are inspiring as heck. Real concrete proof points. Of real people. Who are not that dissimilar to me.
I have to be careful not to start emulating the current behaviors of those examples though. Babies who are still learning to sit up or crawl, when they see other older children running around, don't suddenly stand up and start running! (It does motivate them though, to keep practicing at their stage, getting stronger and growing because the running and jumping looks so fun. The 2nd child learns to walk a bit earlier than the first child as they can see a constant example of what's possible. And there are still physical constrains around developing the muscle strengths. It takes time.).
The above is all a peptalk to myself to continue my current M.O. of slow and steady. Small steps count. One thing for a long time. To not waver in my time realistic workflows in spite of interactions with other indies that energize and inspire me. In fact, let those chats energize me to stay on my path in my lane because I can see examples of what's possible if do (in time, years not weeks). 
I've learned that I can think faster and farther than most. But that's mere thinking. Taking action, doing, manifesting into reality still has those physical constraints. It takes time. So I need pace myself. Commitment and faith, trust the process. And keep talking to people. That's an important piece of the journey too – build relationships and connections. In a way that is productive for me. And because I like people and it's fun.

# Daily 37 Tiny kicks tiny kicks keep it close

That is a motto from a kids Soccer class. And there are three rules that go along with it:
Rule #2 is 'try your best'
Rule #3 is 'believe in your self' (kids say this while pointing both thumbs to their shoulders.)
I've always thought that these two rules are applicable to entrepreneurial pursuits. Or anything where there is not roadmap, no playbook. 
They fall in line with my phrases that I came up with recently to keep myself grounded – commitment (to consistent action) and faith (or trust in the process) 
Rule #1 is something I had dismissed but I am finding a parallel for it now. Rule #1 is 'listen to your coach'. I used to think, in this indie solopreneur world, I gotta be self-sufficient and figure it out on my own. There is no 'coach' person that has all the answers. And that's true but now I'd translate this rule to be 'talk to people and make friends' Talk to people who have overlapping goals/interests and make friends in a way that is productive and useful to both.
So yeah Rule#1 is application as well.
Coming back to this main slogan of The main slogan of Tiny kicks tiny kicks keep it close. What does that have to do with building a business? As I've learned recently, that's everything. Small steps count. Slow but steady. One thing for a long time. These are phrases I think of when I need to center myself and ground myself. But now I can substitute tiny kicks tiny kicks to mean the same thing.
Commitment to consistent action.
Faith in the process.
Talk to people / make friends
Small steps count.

## Daily 36 Rabbit hole from hiring in tech to rails internals

I got an email newsletter today and the topic was hiring in tech.  That was of interest so I read it (immediately instead batching a the end of the day/week) and that lead me down this rabbit hole. 
There are a number of points made in the post. I don't find myself fully agreeing with all of them. Which is interesting to note as just yesterday I finished listening to Remote Ruby podcast's latest interview around Rails 7 with DHH, during my walk. I recall thinking 'man this guy has strong opinions and I can see how he'd rub some people the wrong way but I find myself agreeing with those opinions'. Especially around continuous learning and going deeper with the goal of feeling confident enough to do your own authentication for example. Strong agree.
I agree on technical things maybe not so much on tech industry and culture things.
But back to today's rabbit hole.
From the article in the newsletter I clicked another post about take home tests during intereviews. In there, I found description of a specific take home test extracted from Hey around autocomplete of 'to' field and 'subject' lines. I read that description.
Then got curious about the person who wrote it. A person whose name I've seen many times – Javan. So internet stalked researched him a bit (in my quest to document the humans behind the tech).
His personal site is listed on his github profile. So yes that's the same person behind Stimulus (and I followed him and Sam Sampleton (?) on Twitter after reading about Stimulus). And yes I was right, he is the same person that left Basecamp in April 2021 (after the 'no-politics-at-work' incidents) and tweeted about it. Now he has a new job starting Jan 2022. And yes looks like he does have two young kids and he is into gardening. All according to his Twitter.
I installed Action Text for my book tracking app last week and see his name there too, for creating the Trix editor.
I found this talk from 2014 that he gave about Javascript. Everything in there is familiar to me and makes sense. That was the time I was actually doing production level Rails daily at work (before I had to move to Java/Spring Boot, Angular and all that Jazz).  
The JS tech stack at Basecamp at that time was Coffeescript, JQuery, Backbone, Asset Pipeline.
I forgot that was the year of the name change from 37Signals to Basecamp.
He talks about Single Page Apps and 'Stacker' (Basecamp's internal library to handle responsive page updates without reloading the whole thing. 'Stacker' is what 'became' Turbolinks I think). Different than other SPA where rendering is all done client-side, HTML created from JSON fetched from server. In Basecamp/Stacker world, rendering HTML is mostly done server-side.
Stacker was inspired by PJAX from Github. Turbolinks born out of Stacker.
The reason it feels fasts is client side caching. Mentions 'russian doll' caching.
Then I listened to a Remote Ruby podcast episode (#31) from spring 2019 with Javan and Sam. They were part of a team called Research and Fidality at Basecamp. They talk about the evolution of Turbolinks and Stimulus. I also got to see the evolution of Chris Oliver in the Rails world. A name I only recently learned in mid 2021. One thing for a long time. That's what he embodies. One things for a long time.

What a rabbit hole. And yet I left some stones unturned. All this felt natural to do but not planned. So it counts as a distraction. Writing about it for today's daily post helps serve a purpose in a small way. I wonder if this type of 'research' is of interest to other people. I could share the historical evoluaiton of various tech. How (and why) things came to be how they are today. I can also document the people and some sort of a timeline.

## Daily 35 Uniquely Identifying Books

I'd like to have a database of books with a unique identifier for each book, such that I can relate books to users. User can find the book by 'fuzzy' search and autocomplete from this database. Users who have read the same book do not create multiple copies of the same book. 
Are ISBN numbers a way to do this? I am assuming books have different ISBN numbers depending on the format. So a paperbook would have a different number than a paper book? (I am assuming, haven't looked into this yet). That doesn't really work for my use case, I actually do not want to distinguish between formats. If someway has read a given book in paperback and someone else has listened to the audiobook, I still want it to count as the same book.
So how do I do that? That's what I need to research next.
Another, related thing, I'd like to do is be able to auto fill-in the author's name based on the book title. I wonder if there is a resource (API) where I could look up book author's given the title or ISBN or something. The main advantage of this featue would be to allow users to enter book in a more frictionless way. Like if they didnt remember or didn't know how to spell the author's name, they don't have to worry about it.
Don't have answers yet, but clear on the questions I plan to research.
(Typing this from 11:50 to 11:59, just under the time today. But I didn't miss it.)

## Daily 34 Time

t is so easy to be unrealistic about time. How long something will take? How many things you'll able to do in a given amount of time. No one has extra time, no one has enough time. Everyone is always short on time. 
Jotting down thoughts on my current relationship with time:
In the last few weeks I've returned to timeboxing and time slotting. Time slotting (a phrase I just made up) is more important to me. Putting each task into a timeslot in the day. More importantly if there are no empty timeslots left, explicitely deciding to not do that task (not postpone but not do). 
The other thing that works durig unpredicatable interruptable day is daily habits (that are not tied to a time of day). I will write a post today no matter what. It doesn't matter when (or how long) but I will squeeze that in somewhere somehow. With that intention I am naturally on the lookout for opportunities in my chopped up schedule.
I have been operating at 1/3 the pace of a fulltime employee since March of 2020. I've had 12.5 hours per week, then 15 hours, and then 20 hours week total work time. When I first realize that kids won't be going back to school after spring break in 2020, I nearly had a panic attack (not literally but I felt unprecidented amount of anxiety over what I forsaw). It's not only about the absolute time but also about the momentum. The amount of progress and learning I have made in the last 21 months I could have made in 7 months if I was going at full speed. Ah it's worth acknowledging in writing but I've processed and adapted to this a long time ago. It is what it is.
I talked to a coach person about all this and I must have said "I don't feel like I'm doing enough". The reason is I make unrelistic plans, just wishful thinking. The only cure to that is time slotting. That is working for me in combination with daily habits (I am not surprise, I am the girl in college with a notebook full time tracking my roommates made of fun of if they found it laying around on the coach).
What's trickier as an adult is protecting your time. 

People who become well known due to their success get asked by strangers for their time. For their advice, feedback, opinion. But essentially their time. It's ironic that once you are deeply embedded in a business in a an operation role you don't have time to engage with Internet coworkers.

## Daily 33 Programming feelings

This is a story about one of my programming students, TM, and how I ended up teaching her about feelings (while programming) this week.
TM is currently working on a app that retrieves data from an API and then creates various plots and charts from that data to display to the user. This is a her first independent project for her 'portfolio', where she isn't following along a tutorial or a course. She is working with climate data. This is something she cares about and wants to see exist (I gathered).
I have been guiding her with the high level approach to building. Break things down. Get one piece working at a time, isolate the things. For example, get the charts displayed with hardcoded data first (without worrying about the API). Fetch data from the API, using Postman to parse the JSON response and pluck out the fields you want and log them to the console (don't worry about plotting that data). Last time we met, we ended with getting the above two things working. This week she seemed sort of down/discouraged.
She tried to integrate the two pieces and display the API data on the chart and now 'nothing is working'. She mentioned a couple times that 'it used to work and now it's not working' and that fact seemed to be the cause of her feeling down.
So we debugged together and a little while later got 'it' working again. Got the chart to display with REAL data from the API. I noticed a huge smile on her face after she refreshed the page. A feeling of relief, happiness, satisfaction?
(Which is surprising as she rarely if ever smiles. She is serious/intense. She shows up, follows through, works diligently. She doesn't give up easily. She takes it seriously (at first I thought she was unfriendly as she doesn't ever smile or engage in any pleasantries. She gets right down to questions within 30 seconds of getting on the call. It's still a bit strange, but I now know she is just focused.))
So after giving her my run down of debugging tips, I also added in a lesson on feelings.
When programming you will experience a roller coaster of feelings and thoughts and emotions. You will feel good if you get something tricky working in less time than expected. You will feel irritated if a library you're relying on in introduces breaking changes that blocks you. 
And you will feel discouraged if something you got working stops working. And as an aside, I told TM that when you integrate pieces together issues are to be expected. 
I saw this railsconf talk from justin searls few years ago and it's about programming feelings (among other things). The idea of paying attention to the 'meta' parts while programming (no not metaprogramming) – your actions, thoughts, and feelings – has stuck with me. 
That's why really introspective developers, they might look like they are talking at the whiteboard all day...but they can really have a multiplicative impact on each other as they grow...If we, as an industry, normalize the concept of metacognition and self improvement so we can explain how to program, this whole place might start making a lot more sense.
[Describe my other bad idea for 'dev feelings' app. Almost forgot about this one.]

## Daily 32 2022 Habits and 100 day challenges

Work through the logistics of some new habits I'm considering around the learning intentions I set for this year. All of the ones below the line I am still exploring and will pull them up as I make the existing habits closer to auto pilot.
Committing starting Jan 4
Daily - Record a codelog every day after my working session and post it on "theleafnode" YT channel (min 2 mins, no more than 10 minutes).  Optionally share in 'dev' channel of WC. Watch at the end of the week to improve / iterate. Practise not saying 'umm'
Weekly - send M a weekly written update and then verbally talk to him / show him stuff. Maybe on Fridays. Tell him what I'm thinking for next week.


Learning: Speaking - get better at talking to people, high quality conversations (sharable, record-able ones, i.e podcast)
Habits: 
record some of my daily writing. 
record more "thinking out loud" episodes (bi-weekly or monthly, don't want to get too meta. would prefer to talk about things I've done already not things I have thought about)
record more startup articles or excepts from books I'm already reading.
record my book notes (and distribute them along with the IH series...hm.)
Learning: Interviewing/Listening
Habits:
Indie Chats - try to get to everyone in the WC catchup channel (even if it seems like we don't have anything in common..?)
Repeat Chats in WC - try to get to know these people better and learn from them/ask their advice - Trey, Richa, Hrishi. Reach out to Z about Shopify.
Twitter peeps - Reach out to Helen again. Get back into DMs to peeps whose work I like. 
Have one indie chat (new person or repeat) each week. Or at least reach out to someone once a week and try to make it happen.
Learning: Writing, take it to the next level
Habits:
Keep doing the daily writing. Themed weeks to experiment with more 'controversial' topics - SW industry then gender stuff then my life story. In that order (not ready to tackle the last two but definitely ready to write + share my observations and opinions around the first topic. And ready to get feedback - even the negative kind or the 'I don't know what you mean, I don't get it' kind)
Learning: Teaching at scale
Habits:
record teaching screencasts.
record explainer videos. Explain concepts with powerpoint type presentation (workshop prep). Start with beginner command line, beginner and advance git, editors, deploying stuff (with netlify, vercel, etc.)

Communicating weekly updates + my thinking to M. What I am trying to do and why. Make it all about actions (not thoughts). 
experiment about the format and frequency.

## Daily 31 Affordance and Developer Experience

I read The Design of Everyday Things 8 years ago. There is a story/lesson in that book that still sticks out in my mind.  It's about door knobs. And how the design of a door knob can indicate how the door works (whether you push or pull to open). A good design communicates this information. This is essentially the concept of affordance. But we have all encountered plenty of doors where it isn't clear whether to push or pull.

[picture of door and person]

In that case, we try both ways and eventually get the door to open. It's no big deal. Except when we don't get it right, we do often get the 'oh I'm an idiot' feeling. And this the point the book makes. Users often mistake poor design for their own lack. They accept bad design and attribute their error to themselves. "I'm an idiot, I don't know how to open a door knob haha."
This point has strong parallels to developer tools/frameworks and the role of developer experience in my observation. There are some developer tools (e.g. web frameworks) that have much higher affordance than others. Certain tools actually prioritize good design. The kind where you can tell what to do intuitively, and then when you do something what you expect to happen is what actually happens.
You know the joke about writing hello world in Java vs. Ruby or any interpreted languages with a REPL (though I recall that Java9 introduced a REP but I digress). The point is when developer's encounter poor design, they (even experienced ones) think 'oh it must be me. I'm doing something wrong. I can't figure this out'. 
Early on, many developers take pride in (incidental) complexities in their environment and their ability to grapple with it all. But there comes a point in every developer's career where you care more about not wasting your time than proving that you can chase down some gnarly (but avoidable and unnecessary) issues.
On a related note, I strongly dislike intentional obfuscation. The kind that intimidates newcomers. The documentation that reads like it's written in a foreign language and requires you to look up ten other things. The type of explanations and definitions that make perfect sense if you already know what the Thing is. The poor design in this case does more harm them making someone temporarily feel like an idiot for not being able to open a door. Some newcomers, instead of thinking 'I can't figure this (one thing) out', conclude that 'this (programming as a whole) isn't for me.'

## Daily 30 Lyrics

Complete the motion if you stumble
Music the great communicatorUse two sticks to make it in the nature
Your image in the dictionaryThis life is more than ordinary
This life is more than just a read through -- Can't Stop, RHCP
What I've feltWhat I've knownNever shined through in what I've shownNever beNever seeWon't see what might have been -- Unforgiven, Metalica
Half my life's in books, written pagesLive and learn from fools and from sagesYou know it's true, ohAll the things come back to you -- Dream On, Aerosmith
You're so ahead of yourself that you forgot what you needThough you can see when you're wrongYou know you can't always see when you're right (you're right)
You got your passion, you got your prideBut don't you know that only fools are satisfied? --Vienna, Billy Joel
Look, he's crawling up my wall Black and hairy, very small Now he's up above my head Hanging by a little thread – Boris the Spider, The Who
No, you can't always get what you wantYou can't always get what you wantYou can't always get what you wantBut if you try sometime you'll findYou get what you need – The Rolling Stones

## Daily 29 Skills I will get better at in 2022

Last couple days of the year 2021 are upon us. I feel no desire to make plans, list out my next 20 steps or make a laundry list of goals for 2022. I haven't thought too far ahead (for once!) and don't really feel the need to. I know what I'm doing the next 2 weeks and that's good enough. I'd like to say I feel 100% comfortable with this new mode of operation, but that's not quite true. I do feel a bit uneasy and outside my comfort zone. But I am trying to quit overthinking (and get out of my head) and this new mode is helping with that.
So no plans or goals. However, there are skills I want to learn or skills that I want to take to the next level. So I will write those down here with the purpose of setting the intention and that's all.
Interviewing - listening intently. Asking good follow-up questions. For customers, potential customers, students and also founder friends. This is in the interest of becoming a student of reality. What do real people actually do or think about X, how do they really use Y. 
Storytelling - stories around teaching, stories about my product. And later my own story. By writing first then recording.
So those two things basically add up to get better at talking to people :) I already enjoy talking to people one-on-one but I want to intentionally make podcast-worthy high quality conversations/interviews eventually. So these skills are in preparation of that.
Writing - next level writing. Writing essays to make a point. Even on potentially controversial topics (all within the software industry to start off with. I have many opinions and observations and things that need to be said). I want to write thought provoking things.
Community building - brand new to this. start learning from first principles. The theory around what makes a good community. Learn from books and reading but also from talking to people I already know who run communities.
Teaching at scale - via workshop, cohort based things. Also teaching via writing and screencasting. Also find my style around marketing my teaching - ranking for questions in search + youtube (SEO).
I have no specific expectations or measurable metrics in mind around the above intentions. One possible desirable side effect could be a podcast full of conversations. Or screencasts + audio recordings of SW topics. 
If I find a way to consistently put a drop in the bucket over a long time, I can consider it a success.

## Daily 28 Tshirt Quotes

Once upon a time I had this idea to make developer t-shirts with quotes on them. But not like the one that says "there are 10 types of people in the world. Those that understand binary and those that don't". Yuck. Not the snobby kind. My tshirts would be called "humble dev tees". 
I hired someone on fiverr to make a tshirt design with one the below quotes and then got a sample tshirt printed (a nice fitted bella+canvas one). It came out alright, not as nice as I was imagining. I wore that one for a while. And that's how far I got with that idea.
Here are all the possible quote options I have collected so far:
“Turtles all the way down” 
"Ambiguity breeds confusion” 
"Complexity is where the bugs hide.” 
“Keep calm and debug on” 
“Sometimes the hardest part of programming is figuring out the easiest way to do it” 
“Not all who wander are lost" 
“Simple ain’t easy” 
“Later is the enemy of Now” 
“Good is the enemy of Great” 
“On Programming: Don't live with broken windows" 
"A good programmer is someone who looks both ways before crossing a one-way street" 
“On Programming: First do it, then do it right, then do it better.” 
Compound interest formula: A = P * (1 + r) ^ t 
"Testing can show the presence of errors, but not their absence.”  On Software Testing 
"If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in." 
"Theory and practice sometimes clash. And when that happens, theory loses. Every single time.” - Linus torvalds on Theory 
"Fools ignore complexity. Pragmatists suffer it. Some can avoid it. Geniuses remove it.” - On complexity 
Programmer's prayer: pleaseworkpleaseworkpleaseworkpleasework 
"Sometimes, the elegant implementation is just a function. Not a method. Not a class. Not a framework. Just a function." 
"Optimism is an occupational hazard of programming; feedback is the treatment." 
"In programming, the hard part isn't solving problems, but deciding what problems to solve."

## Daily 26 Jokes

Let me collect all the silly jokes I can think of in one place. 
This is a holiday week technically, the days between xmas and new years. So I will write more lighter (and less time consuming things). Because I still feel like writing and keeping up with this daily habit.
Here we go:
1.
What did the baby volcano say to the mommy volcano?
I lava you
2.
Do you wanna hear my new Fibonacci joke?
Nah. Nevermind. It's as bad as the last two combined.
3. 
Do you wanna hear a joke about sodium?
Na
That one is from siri 
4. 
Where do pencils go on vacation?
Pennsylvania
That one is courtesy of R (so proud)
5.
Why is six afraid of seven?
Because. Seven eight nine!
An oldie but goody. First joke I ever taught R.
6. 
I didn't understand why the baseball kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger

Joey say let's go with ducks because "ducks have heads". The next line could have been "but clowns have heads too" but no that is so meak compared to the what the genious friends writers came up with.
9.

## Daily 25 Web3 essay reactions continued

Thoughts and reactions from this essay The Web3 Renaissance: A Golden Age for Content
The lived experiences of creators tell the story: 90% of streaming royalties on Spotify go to the top 1.4% of musicians. The top 1% of all streamers earn more than half of all revenue on Twitch. 1% of podcasters claim the majority of podcast ad revenue.
I've heard this before for teaching platforms (e.g. teachable) where small percent of teachers earn majority of the revenue.
While it's true there is money to be made from content on the Internet, the essay notes that "much of that money has bypassed the creators that produce the content, landing instead in the pockets of the platforms that aggregate it."
The problem with web2 seems to be the lack of native monetization methods for creators. The Internet was not built to facilitate the flow of money, payments were not built into the Internet's infrastructure. This is supposedly called the original sin of the Internet (by Marc Andreessen). 
That is the argument for why users are currently monetized through advertising:
The lack of payment infrastructure is the reason why so much of the internet is monetized via advertising. Rather than requiring users to pull out a credit card and type their information into a website, users could be monetized frictionlessly and indirectly, paying not with their money but with a different asset: their attention
And the implications this model has for both the users and for content creators are enormous. Users are funneled to content that's already popular creating a power law. Content creators are incentivized to create content that appeals to the broadest possible audience and content that can easily attract advertisers. 
This leads to incentivizing viral, attention-grabbing, and aspirational content, while disincentivizing niche, in-depth content.
New incentives that reward new behavior
That is how web3 concepts can be characterized. The essay outlines 4 main ways that this will happen:
By introducing digital scarcity and restoring pricing power to creators
By making supporting creators an act of investment, not just altruism
By introducing new programmable economic models that spread wealth across the creator landscape
Most importantly, by creating pathways for creators to own not just the content they produce, but the platforms themselves
I get #2, that makes total sense. It's about aligning incentives. If the creator succeeds and you've bet on them early by investing in them then your investment also yields higher returns.
I also get #4 (alluding to decentralized autonomous organization DAO)  Co-ownership makes sense and again serves to align incentives. This is like giving employees options. Is this not similar to the existing business model by the name of workers owned co-operative. Cheeseboard in Berkeley was the first example of this I ever came across. The website says workers owned co-op since 1971.
There is more of the Cheeseboard story in their about us. It defines co-ops as:
A worker cooperative is an enterprise that produces goods, distributes goods and/or provides services and is owned and controlled by its worker-owners. Ownership of a worker cooperative is vested solely with the worker-owners on an equal basis. Worker-owners control the resources of the cooperative and the work process
I didn't really get #3 before reading this, but the essay makes it pretty clear. It's about royalties and the idea that creators can benefit from their work being remixed and used in collaboration down the road (e.g. sound track in a Youtube videos, memes). The programmable economic model in essence is the ability to distribute these money automatically to the original creators via their wallets.
It's #1 that is the least clear to me introducing digital scarcity and restoring pricing power. Yes this is alluding to Non Fungible Tokens NFTs. It is still an artificial scarcity. What about people who don't actually want to own stuff, physical or digital (wannabe minimalists like me). I've seen the analogy of collectibles such as art and sports stuff used to explain NFTs. Aren't both of those things about status? The value is based on artificial scarcity and desirability. But I guess it works as long as all parties involved keep up the charade (like diamonds!). Still learning about this one.  
There is one new thing I learned about NFTs I didn't know in the essay:
Excitingly, the introduction of scarcity through NFTs doesn’t mean that access to the underlying media is limited, as it would be with paywalls or paid digital downloads. The actual media underpinning NFTs can remain public goods, available to be consumed by anyone at no cost. Those who think this undermines the scarcity of NFTs (“right-click and save”) fundamentally miss the point.
So it's not about restricting access but more about having bragging rights by being able to prove that you own something via record on the chain.

## Daily 24 Web3 essay content is king reactions

The phrase "content is king" is from an essay Bill Gates published on the Microsoft website in 1996 apparently. Here are some striking passages from it given the year (this was before YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok):
Content is where I expect much of the real money will be made on the Internet, just as it was in broadcasting
The long-term winners will be those who use it to medium to deliver information and entertainment. And he goes on to include software as content, an extremely important one. 
Side note: If I had read this before I guess there wouldn't have been a reason to debate SaaS vs. content path. Or feel strange about calling myself a content creator from software engineer. It's all the same why not.
Okay so back to this essay, I note the mention of online communities in this sentence:
I expect societies will see intense competition-and ample failure as well as success-in all categories of popular content-not just software and news, but also games, entertainment, sports programming, directories, classified advertising, and on-line communities devoted to major interests
He goes on to sort of predict online communities in the form that we see now in 2021. If we people are expected to turn on their computer to read a screen they expect to be rewarded with content that is deeper and an opportunity for personal involvement that goes far beyond that offered through the letters-to-the-editor pages of print magazines. Personal connections between members all of who share a common goal/interests is what successful communities have in common.
So what does all this have to do with web3? (wasn't it web 2.0, this inconsistency in nomenclature bugs me...oh well).
For the Internet to thrive, content providers must be paid for their work. The long-term prospects are good, but I expect a lot of disappointment in the short-term as content companies struggle to make money through advertising or subscriptions. It isn’t working yet, and it may not for some time.
He then goes on to lay out the whole advertising business model and compares that to subscription revenue and the challenges of charging 'small amounts' for content on the Internet.
This is the essay I was originally reading, which references the above "content is king" essay. This one's got all the things - NFTs, DAOs, digital scarcity. It's called The Web3 Renaissance: A Golden Age for Content from Li Jin's newsletter (who I heard a while back on the Indiehacker's pod). The essay itself can be collected as an NFT. Of course. 
When I first opened it, it was $700 now it's over $5000. Incidentally, that's what people would spot and get attracted to first in midst of all this stuff. The money and the possibility making a lot of it quickly I think. 
But Li's essay does a good job of first principles analysis of the current state of this world. It's a good overview, I'd recommend reading it. (though I have no idea how it compares to other content out there on this topic, I haven't spent much time on it). And I definitely recommend the "content is good" essay for historical reference.
[I spent most of my writing time reading today so will have to continue this tomorrow.]

## Daily 23 All the things I quit in 2021

The end of this calendar year is approaching. Seems I should do a review of the last 12 months in some way. I think I will write down all the projects I've tried over the last year. And also why I quit them. Perhaps I'll go in chronological order.
Morning co-working -  I did this for 100 days from 6am to 7am every week day for a period of 5 months in late 2020/early 2021. It was something I always wanted to do since college. Get up early to work before everyone else is up. I finally did it with some consistency. 
The same 3 people showed up for a lot of it. That was a nice side effect to make their acquiescence. 
Status - I didn't quit this. The goal was 100 days and I achieved this goal. I kept doing this on my own for most of 2021 (depending what was going on with school), but not as consistently. I used this time to meet up with people for "coffee chats", for workout. I don't have a set morning routine and I feel like I never will while there is unpredictability around kids. And I now I now I can do have my morning hour whenever I choose to, I have a system. 
Writing Feedback Group - This was an idea I dreamed up (in the shower I think), wrote it out in my notebook, put out a message/event in Ness Labs, and people came. 40 people filled out my excel form then 6-8 people actually participated weekly. I remember working out the logistics one Friday evening (once I already had some traction) and made the templates excel and Google Docs to use during the live sessions. I did 4 live sessions every Friday morning.
Status - I intended to ran this for X weeks and I did. It was a cool feeling to see something I dreamed up come to life. It was a lot of work and I learned that it's not worthwhile doing for free. Also I didn't really care to read certain people's writing (too political and out there). In the future, I'd limit it to Indie biz writing.
The Leaf Node newsletter - vision was to write and share what I was learning. Which I did from December 2020 to August of 2021. For 9 months. But it felt a little empty in some ways. I turned it into the CodeCurious newsletter and sent screencasts. Then when I stopped making screencast one week, I stopped sending the newsletter too.
Status - quit because I ran out of topics to write about I think. Also there was a lack of any feedback or exchange. I sent it to ~150 people but never knew who they were, never connected. (Hm...actually I do recall getting a handful of nice replies early on and people say they love my writing. I guess I forgot about those. But still wasn't enough) 
Why It Works IndieHackers Series - noticed that this was an option so I applied, Channing got back to me, gave me his telegram handle. And I started with Leave Me Alone story, which was on the front page and got tons of subscribers. In the end I did 6 or 7 episodes and collected ~475 subscribers. So it definitely had resonance. I framed it as "how they got their first 100 customers", I think I got this idea from someone else on the newsletter telegram doing something similar with success. I was sending these stories to "The Leaf Node" newsletter as well (before I switch it to CodeCurious).
Status - I stopped after 6 or  7 weeks. Bored of reading other people's stories. Also I never got a chance to connect with the people I was writing about, which I thought would happen but it didn't (e.g. I reached out to the Leave Me Alone founders and they never got back to me). I also learned of some yellow flags about the Teaching company (like doing fake 'live' webinars and pretending). 
IndieHacker's pod database of insights - 26 in 26 days. It was great to do. It was tedious at times but I was in flow state. I had a process worked out. I listened while walking, jotted down in a notebook I placed at the edge of the countertop. The I transferred the notes to the airtable database. I tweeted at the people whose episode I just listened to. I posted on twitter when I'd done 10 episodes as a preview. I got to DM-ing with a few of the guests (including Mubs). Arvid Kahl commented and followed up. That was the first time I got any traction/engagement on Twitter and it was fun (and also short lived).
Status - quit. reason = bored of listening to other people's stories. Ready to create my own story. Quit listening to podcasts and went on an advice consumption diet for 100 days (~3 months) after this. That was good. I don't feel the need to listen to too many podcasts for advice or even read articles. I started feeling like I know what to do, like I see patterns repeated. Getting down to some truths.
Community Finder - Intention was to use no-code tools. Used webflow, launched it on Product Hunt (in 20 minutes on a whim). I think it made it to the bottom of the front page with ~50 votes so hey all good. Was expecting crickets. I was not planning to charge for this nor did I position it in a way that I could.
Status - didn't feel like paying $20/month to webflow to host it. So took it off. There is something to this idea, more than one person DM-ed few months later looking for it. 
CodeCurious screencasts - started by recording Javascript stuff, ES6 stuff. I got to 15 videos over a few weeks.
Status - hm..not sure. I haven't quit but I'm also not working on this. This is something that I see in my future. Maybe starting in a more lower pressure way, make screencasts for future Bhumi to remember stuff (e.g how to install and configure redis or how to use stripe cli or some concept like important maps)
Thinking Out Loud podcast - this was an experiment. Something I did without giving it too much thought. My goal was to learn the logistics of podcasting, to publish something and get it to show up in my podcast player. Kinda like a hello world podcast so I did that. The secondary goal was to process my thoughts but do it more publicly, build in public and whatnot. 
Status - I still want to do something like this in some form. The main reason I didn't do a second episode is because the first one took way too long to write and record (most of the time was writing). Like 10 hours. 
CodeCurious Group Mentorship - made a landing page. Got people to fill out the form. Contacted 7 people, had one meeting, one no-show, some emails. 
Status - there is still something to this idea. Live interactive teaching is personally appealing to me vs. making 'content' and posting. It would be more natural and less pressure to be perfectly recorded. Doing a take#2 of this is on deck for Q1 of next year. I can also try group teaching by applying to teach remotely at one of the coding bootcamps (hackbright?).
Shopify subscription app/business - motivator is the desire to create a B2B SaaS business for the 4M dream. This came to an inflection point in mid to end November. (will need to do a seperate write-up, too long)
Status - on hold. While I focus on doing the thing I actually think I want to do (teaching, writing/reading, coding)
Indie Book Notes - started as a way of doing daily things. Reading and taking notes and sharing. First book was Deploy Empathy on customer interviews, second is The Boron Letters on copywriting. I like both of these. My note taking process probably needs some streamlining. It takes a bit too long. But it's okay. I do the slow reading thing.
Status - ongoing.
Couple more things.
Not a project but an initiative I started this year was habit tracking in a notebook daily - I quit this in July and gave up in August. It was a matter of what was going on in family life. I am happy about the experiments I did at the beginning of the year, the recording myself reading startup essays daily and the sketchnotes especially.
One other thing I attempted is "Indie Austin". This failed or at least it didn't go anywhere with the approach I used. Which was posting a meetup on IndieHackers. It needs a different approach. Ideally I want to just join an existing local indie community but there doesn't seem to be any (talked to Channing and Charlie about this).

deep breath That was quite an exercise to write all this down. Didn't exactly make me feel good about myself seeing all the things I quit. A more positive way to look at it of course is that I tried, took action. And this was all in 12.5 to 16 hours per week of work time.

## Daily 22 Twitter and Pride

I have this recurring urge to engage on twitter and do things like 100-days-of-tweeting challenge. Why? If I am being honest, it's to get my follower count to 4 digits. It's all a perception thing, but I am pretty sure everyone hovers over and looks at that number to decide how seriously they take someone new they encounter. 
Less than 1000 followers, this person's a nobody. While flying under the radar sounds just fine to me, I don't want to miss out on the possibility of connecting with my kinda interesting people because of my twitter neglect (not to mention potential customers). And I have this belief that you need a minimum of 1000 follower's to appear legit. I feel like once I have that number, my brain would be done with this recurring thought. And I'd be fine with letting things coast and evolve naturally. (As of now that's how I feel. I know there is a risk of keep moving that 'goal post'. I recall hearing Courtland say on the IH pod once that he was in some group chat where everyone's goal was to get to 100k followers on twitter. why? no reason, it would just be cool. Hm..sigh. It's all relative, this number thing).
On the other hand, the other part of my brain is like why does it matter. I am not going to spend time tweeting just for some number. (Also do I even know what it will take or if tweeting would even work). I am too cool to care. It's a pride thing. An ego thing.
I only tweeted a handful of times, once every few weeks for most of 2021 I think (I'm not sure, I should check, but it's on the block list). 
I actually don't mind twitter. It hasn't been that distracting for me. I don't feel like I waste too much time on it. Probably because 1. I have it blocked most of the work day, except evening. 2. I don't have too many twitter friends so most of the time it's boring to be scrolling and reading random updates.
Ironically if I start tweeting and collecting followers and hopefully friends, then this will change. I will find it distracting and could get sucked into wasting time.
The thing that I like about Twitter is DMs. I use it to send messages to people whose work I like. If I find something they made useful, or if I listen to podcast interviews and find resonance in their story, I tell them that.  
I keep it short and simple. Most people reply and are thankful. That's it. I don't follow that up with anything else. It's mostly about putting out some positive vibes out there in the universe. 
I have stopped doing this over the last few months. This would be one reasonable thing to restart. The other thing of first-hand tweeting, I guess I do have things to share (book notes, etc.). The only way this will happen is if I work it in my process. I don't want to do this whenever. So after I publish newsletter, make a little thread and post. Time box it. Don't want to dwell on it too much. And just do it.

## Daily 21 Lessons and Insights

My mind is closer to an empty state. In a good way. Where I feel like I don't have anything new to process or analyze. Not quite there but getting close to the clarity I am looking for. 
No other rambling today. Instead let me summarize lessons and insights so far.
There is something to doing one thing for a long time. Because compounding. 
Small steps. One day at a time. That is a valid way to go. (Small steps never feel like enough to me. So I have to keep working on this mindset. For example the daily writing, the weekly book notes sharing. Didn't feel like enough when I started. Still doesn't if I'm being honest. But still glad I am doing it. Better than nothing). In fact, small steps is how I could keep doing one thing for a long time. Start small. And even go slow. Slow and steady.
Sharable work. Publishing my writing has been good for the last 4 weeks. (I want to write even more sharable, less ramble-y, things and share consistently and more publicly). Making an email list for the book notes has been good. I have no plans for those subs (or do I? Hm..) but sending that email once a week for the last 6 weeks has been good for working on the consistency muscle. 
Passion about the vision paired with stoic execution. ("in the clouds" and "in the weeds" shifting balance necessary from 80/20 to 20/80 )
Do the thing that interests you, things that you have enthusiasm for directly. Don't plan to do X first (because that's where you think the money is) and then plan to do the thing you really want to do later. It remains to be seen if this will be good advice to follow (or a good decision to stop chasing the b2b SaaS ideas for the sake of the $4M dream). 
Talking to people is a good idea. After keeping to myself and thinking 'indie' means I have to figure everything out by myself, I decided to make an intentional effort to talk to people in the 2nd half of 2021. Joining a paid community, coaching trial, mastermind, daily standup, one-on-one chats. (failed to find local IRL indie people but covid isn't helping. The time for that will come, but it is not now). All the above came at a cost of time (which I'm forever rationing). But all of the above was a net positive change and I hope to continue to make the best of the Internet and connect with others in way that is productive and helpful to both. Feel grateful for all the Internet friends and acquaintances.

## Daily 20 Oh I see how I've been in Idiot

That is a pretty valuable realization. To clearly see how you've been an idiot and pinpoint a flow in your thinking. I look forward to these as a sign that I'm learning and growing.
One such realization is this idea of doing everything systematically. The idea of walking the path of entrepreneurship with some grace and elegance. 
One of my programming students recently shared this aspiration he has: I really want to code a data structure from scratch. I want to code from memory without looking anything up and I want to see how fast I can do it. 
I smiled (and shook my head, inside). I explained that while that's a nice thought, it's not necessary to be able to do that. ever. to be an effective software developer or to have productive career.
(he is smart guy, studious, has a PhD in chemistry and has transitioned to software in the last year. I imagine he could do the above, but that wouldn't be the point)
I recognize this type of thinking. This type of earnestness. Some (misplaced) desire for excellence. 
Similarly, I can sense that there are things I've been thinking around entrepreneurship that would seem plain naive to someone who's already done this entrepreneur-ing thing in practice before.
In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice, there is.
I remember this from one my commencement speech. I don't know who was the speaker and what else they said. But I distinctly remember the above words.
In practice, programming is messy. Always will be. No matter how much experience you get. (I know this now, didn't always. There was a time when I thought I was going to learn EVERYTHING and be perfect at it). There is no perfection to be had. 
Why would business building be any different. There is only so much I can learn from other's experience. There is only so much I can learn from books and theory. Practice is where it's at.

## Daily 19 Insight - do the thing you really want to do now not later for X

I heard something more than once, in independent places, within the span of a few days. I should write it down in the "Life Insights" file in my Evernotes. (The last entry in there was months ago, I guess I haven't had any insights in a while). The possible insight is this:
Don't wait. Don't defer the thing you really want to do. Don't plan to do X and then after X is done plan to do the thing you really feel called to do.
The first place where I saw this was in the The Boron Letters (chapter 5):
Usually, when someone asks me what is the #1 big secret to making money I tell them they should get involved in whatever excites them the most.
This is good advice. Money, in my opinion, especially big money, is most often a by product of enthusiasm. If a person, secretly in his heart, wants to be an architect, he shouldn't go into selling real estate, for example, just because he has heard that that is where the money is. The money is where the enthusiasm is.
The second place I heard this was on the My First Million pod. Shaan Puri telling Hasan Minhaj about advice from a Twitch executive about not waiting. Or doing a thing you don't like for 5 years so then you can do the thing you really want to do. That usually doesn't work out and people don't ever end up doing the other thing.
This insight has bit of a caveat though. Not everyone has the privilege required to just go do the thing they really want to do. 
This also jives with the two things NG told me when I resigned. He said it's good that I'm going all in. And he shared that he had tried doing his own thing a while ago but he always had one foot in the corporate world and eventually went to back to being an engineering executive. And that he still wants to do his own thing. But I see on LinkedIn that he is tool another job as an EVP of engineering (The 2nd thing he told me is that "it will be lonely, even for an introvert like you" hah, yeah. I didn't believe him. I did take full 2 years before I felt like I really need to talk to other people though)
This advice/insight has layers though. Even within doing your own thing. My interest in the shopify ecosystem and doing a B2B SaaS stems from the 4M thing. It's been about 10 days since I decided to set that aside for now. Still figuring out how to more directly pursue what I really want to do.
One approach (as mentioned in MFM) is figuring out what you need, in terms of money, skills, connections to do the thing you really want to do. And then work on acquiring those.

## Daily Internet Friends Message to Hrishi

(Sorry for the wall of text. I do have a point and a question at the end)
It's over-communicating, more so than oversharing, probably. Looking back, one realization is that chatting every day is not sustainable nor a good idea.
(Hey I'm not complaining though I know it seems like I am. I even thank you later, keep reading). I'm still new here, to working on the Internet. And I'm working out the differences between making Internet friends and life friends in real-time. But that's something for me to figure out for myself. .
In reality, none of us have the headspace to keep up with anyone on a play-by-play basis. Moreover, I don't want to form habits or have expectations of anyone else around my work. (I don't talk to anyone daily except my immediate family members. I certainly don't talk to my closet IRL friends daily)
But there are two sides to everything – you asking what I worked on and checking on me frequently over the last few weeks certainly played a role in me doing my daily things in terms of accountability/motivation. So I thank you for that, sincerely.
My views on Internet friendships are evolving. Initially I thought that I need to really get to know few other indie people and form deeper bonds in order to actually help each other. But now I see that as "in the clouds" thinking. In practice loose connections with many people with overlapping interests/goals are very useful. Plus the former requires a big investment in time/energy which would be hard to justify given the nature of Internet connections (they can be ephemeral).
So here comes the setup for my question: What I'd like to do is have a handful to indie peeps (4-5 peeps) that I could keep up with on a rotating basis. Meeting every 4 to 6 weeks to update on each other's work and talk shop. I think that could be a good setup to build a little support network. Plus it should motivate both people to have something to share that they've shipped, this kinda social accountability works! Also since there is enough distance the other person can spot warning flags, as in 'hey you said you wanted to make X happen but sounds like you've been in some other rabbit hole last couple weeks' and help steer you back.
My question to you is this: Would you be up for trying this monthly chats? Starting in January. And with the intention of keeping it about the "finite" and "in the weeds" topics (at least 80% of the time, no excessive "in the cloud" life philosophy I promise).
Your reaction could be 'I don't like to make such commitments or plan that far ahead." And that's cool, I get it. I can put in my calendar to ping you around mid Jan and see if you're up for a call then. And we could go from there.
Sorry again about the wall of text (turned out to be more than expected when I started typing). But I've given it some thought and I wanted to communicate more directly (rather than be aloof or weird about it). As I said I'm still working out the differences between making Internet friends and life friends. It is so different. For one there is no food involved! Most of my real life friendships revolve around sharing food.
It's easy to make a lot of acquaintance online. But are we acquaintances or are we friends. On the Internet, there is not a big difference, is there? So I have now decided that we are friends.
So. Alright my friend, that is all for me. Hope it makes sense.
(And all I'm looking for in response is answer to the question. Don't feel like you need write some long response. Spend your times in your weeds instead!).

## Daily 18 My Writing Feedback Group

Consistency may be the key to starting a writing/creating habit, but feedback is the reward that sustains it. The way to improve at writing is a feedback loop and connection with the target audience.
That is what I wrote on my "landing page" for this Writing Feedback Group experiment I ran about a year ago. Below is rest of the text, before asking interested people to fill out a Google form. 38 people filled out the form. I ran the group for 5 weeks and half dozen people came to the live meetings and few more participated async (in the spreadsheets I made)
Writing Feedback Group: the vision is to have a group of people meet weekly for a fix duration (6 to 8 weeks). During each live session, we read each other's writing and provide written feedback (e.g in a google doc with author shared custom questions they want answered like "is my copy convincing", "did I make my point", "is my explanation clear" etc.). It's for people who've been writing but now want to iterate and improve their writing and get the reward of reader feedback.
I am writing about this today because I'm wondering if I should do a take #2 of this project at some point in the coming weeks. 
I put a decent amount of thought and work into it. But I never did figure out if I could or should make it a paid thing. If I did that, it would help justify time/effort. So how would I do it? Here are some notes on what I would change from last time:
Make the live sessions more interactive. Could be discussion on a specific struggle. Could be presentation on main takeaways from books such as "On Writing", "On Writing Well", "The Boron Letters". 
Narrow the participants to more indie founders
Make the writing themed. So instead of anything goes, it would be more for business writing. Marketing content, cold emails, copy for landing page, or personal blog or newsletters
Not sure if I will do this. But there is something to this idea. I thought so at the time too. And it makes sense logically, the promise of getting feedback on what you write is naturally appealing. Also I recently learned of two products/writing communities that do something like this: Foster and WriterBloc. Haven't looked into exactly how these work but someone said Foster was 'expensive'. So evidence that people already do pay to improve their writing/get feedback, etc.
The other thing that was cool about this project is that I dreamed it up (the concept, the format, the logistics everything) and then got to see it come to life. Just went and did it, that was a cool feeling which I had forgotten about. 
More on this later.

## Daily 17 "It doesn't work" rant

A friendly rant. This is a lesson on debugging that I've taught to almost every single student of programming I've interacted with. Sooner or later it always comes up. Writing up the first draft of a possible post for CodeCurious here. 

Don't ever say "It doesn't work". Instead tell me (or yourself, if you're rubber ducking):
What did I try, specifically what did I do?
What did I expect to happen? 
Why did I expect that outcome?
If the outcome was not what I expected, did I get an error message?
What did it say? Yes the error message, what did it say? Read it again.
Sometimes there is an actual bug with our logic, sometimes it's a typo. Sometimes our expectations are wrong. 
When we walk up to a co-worker (or post on slack these days) and say "Aah! I tried X and it doesn't work", there is nothing else they can say except "what do you mean?" So provide context.
When things don’t work as we expected, we get worried and start debugging but sometime stepping back and understanding the ‘rules of engagement’ is what is needed.
All of this is easier said than done in the moment. Yes I too shake my fist at the screen and mumble stuff when things don't just work as I expect them to.
The most effective debugging tool is still careful thought, coupled with judiciously placed print statements. — Brian W. Kernighan

## Daily 16 Comfort in the Clouds, Joy in the Weeds

I've narrowed down 3 main culprits for my lack of visible progress in my entrepreneurial journey over the last few months. And below thread hints at one of them. I'll come back to that one at the end.

The first 2 reasons I got out of my Friday chat with D. 
Looking for a guarantee
When learning and doing research on subjects outside of my wheelhouse (e.g. marketing, sales), I've been looking for patterns and fundamental truths. I think I've founds some, which is good. But going beyond that I think I've been looking for a roadmap as well. I am ready to work hard and actually want to work hard. Bu before I do that, I want to prove to myself that if I do x, y and z for 2 years it will result in some desirable outcome. I am looking at other people and what they've done and looking to collect data points based on their experience. And I've successfully found some data points. I keep looking for more. Like a playbook to follow that will more or less guarantee success. There is no such thing.
[Add story of the a fitness thing, where there are some guarantees. I just did it, for 12 weeks got all checkmarks every day. No execuses. No overthinking. Just followed the process. Kept a log of weekly progress which was helpful] 
Scarcity mindset, in terms of time
This feeling that I don't want to waste any of work time working on the wrong thing or making avoidable mistakes that cost me a lot of time. So I don't dive into anything and work on it long enough unless I can prove ahead of time that it'll work. If I see it not working then I bolt and look for something else to do. This is also related to this fear. Fear of working hard on something (making sacrifices in other aspect of life) and then having that thing not get traction, having that thing fail. The imagined pain from this potential outcome has prevented me from throwing myself into something and working hard on it. Partly because, I know this:
Traction is more connected to underlying demand than founder effort. Effort in != Revenue out. So just because I work hard on something, doesn't mean it has to work out. Those two things are not related in that way. (The above from Justin Jackson newsletter from this week but the lesson I learned 1.5 years ago and Courtland Allen has also mentioned this on the IH pod a few times).
This last one is from the above thread on WeekendClub. And this one is the main culprit I think.
Head in the clouds
"doing anything results in– It’s actually kind of tragic because it means you sacrifice how gorgeous and perfect it is in your head for what it really is”
and
"I oscillate between being lost in the cloud and buried in the weeds" 
Well put. Precisely. I am surprised to read this. And how well it resonates with my thoughts. Theoretically I know I'm not unique (none of us are), but still is surprising to run into kindred spirits on the Internet. Just casually dropping by.
So back to 'what is your problem Bhumi', I think it's this. I've come to this bittersweet place where I've done the learning and planning and researching (and I've enjoyed that process). Now it's time go for it. Sift to action, to manifestation. 
This prediction that the reality won't be a match for what's been in my head is correct. It won't. But it's also true that while there is comfort in the clouds there is joy in the weeds. And even when that joy is accompanied by pain and discomfort, it's worth it. I've experience the joy of being in the weeds and actually manifesting my dreams into reality before. No matter how imperfect and messy and painful it feels in the moment, it always feels worthwhile in the end. While being in the clouds is comfortable, it's unsatisfying after some time. 
Only thing left to do is match my passion for a vision with stoic execution. Muddle through the messy parts of this journey. One day at a time. But also one thing for a long time.

## Daily 15 What I hate most about marketing

There is newsletter called "everyone hates marketing" that I used to subscribe to. The first email asked this question:

I never did reply to that email. But this is a good writing prompt.
What I really 'hate' about marketing is that it isn't taught in the engineering world or even thought of as a valid skill. It isn't respected by developers who are purely in an employment setting. Only if you move towards entrepreneurship you start to get hints that it's something you'll need to care about. Then if you're like me, you check out half a dozen books on marketing from the library and read them all. Umm..that doesn't do much. Sure some principles seep through to your brain but it doesn't help in any concrete way (unlike reading a book on a programming language for example. That will make you a better at programming in that language.)
If you have no aspirations to learn to market, you're so far behind. You have first shift your mindset to care about and respect it as a skill in order to have any hope of mastering it.
The truth is while there is such a thing as no-code which allows non-programmers to build and launch a product successfully. Especially if they have marketing background.
There is no such thing as no-marketing. There aren't any no-marketing tools like webflow and bubble that will just take what you build and automatically find customers for it. That's not a thing. As a builder you have to do the marketing.

The other thing about marketing is that it's a bit of an indirect dance. I have this urge to be like 'okay let me level with you. Yes I am selling something and I'll tell you how much it is upfront. Here's what you get from it and here's what I get. If it feels like a win-win, then please sign up' 
But that's not how it works. You have to play a little game. Engage in bit of a charade. For one, you don't reveal the product and price upfront. You provide value, bring your potential customers along on a journey (a funnel) and then have the 'offer' at the end when they're primed an ready to buy. (the pain-dream-fix approach).
Lastly, applying all the marketing principles feel especially tough if what you have to market is yourself (in the teaching context). I read that "people buy from you because they know you, like you, trust you". My corollary to that is: well if you believe you're trustworthy, likeable person then you better do everything you can to allow people to know you. Your potential customers. (this advice is tough to apply, as an introvert who doesn't care to draw attention to herself)

## Daily 14 What's it for? Who it's for?



These are the two questions you need to answer about your product to identify your audience and niche. I think it's from one of Seth Godin's blogs.

For teaching content, these are open decisions I need to make. Who is it for? And what's it for?

Who is it for?

I have two options here – It can be for beginners/people learning to code or it could be for seasoned developers. There are pros and cons to both. There is already a ton of beginner content out there. Does there need to be more? On the other hand, there are always new people learning to code and seeking new material. There is less content for more advanced developers. At the same time, do seasoned developers really seek out tutorials and screencasts? At some point, don't you just feel like you'll go read the docs and figure it out. You don't readily search for learning materials. On the other hand, if there is some good quality material summarizing a new tech, that could save you time. Trust is important in this case. I wouldn't likely invest time to watch or read from someone I just found (to see if they'll save me time). I would have some go-to people whose style I'm familiar with and I'd go see if they have something on my new topic (e.g. Ryan Bates in the Railscast days, or Greg Polluck from CodeSchool). This in turn implies that I would need to present a consistent style in order to build trust. Like people know what to expect.

The other decision in the who's it for category is this: should I stick to one tech (e.g. Rails) or should I teach stuff that's common across programming regardless of tech stack. I think the answer is I have to stick to one tech stack, at least to start. I don't see any examples of anyone successfully doing a variety of tech. Of the teachers I know, Trey is all about Python, Hrishi is about Rails/React, Shruti is about CSS/Tailwind. Other examples from the Internet: Chris Oliver is about Rails. Kent Dodds is about React. Wes Boss is about Javascript. Then there are sites like egghead. That has a bit of variety but the different tech content is from different people.

What's it for?

This is more tricky. Why should someone consume my teaching content? What will it help them do? Will it help them get their first programming job? Will it help them get promoted to senior role? Will it help them feel more confident about a tricky concept? Will it help them save time on learning something they need to know for work?

Originally, I thought an easy place to start maybe by recording screencasts answering questions from my current students. And I did that a little bit. For example, Julian wanted to know how to integrate social login with facebook in his Rails app. So I did it locally and made a short screencast for him demonstrating the steps. I think this is a good start but I don't think it'll work to build a cohesive audience. Because Frida has Angular questions and Victor has React questions and Tanisha is plotting API data using D3 and Chart.js and Antonius is learning css/sass and media queries.  

All the above would make for very disparate content. It works for one-on-one teaching. But for content creation, I can't be like I teach all programming related things to anyone. Everything for everyone is a marketing sin.

Also based on what Richa was saying about YouTube, you have to nail down your niche and your audience in order to grow (assuming that's where I start until I can build out an email list).

So I don't yet know what it will be for, what will be my promise.

I recognize that I won't be able to think my way to these answers. I'll probably have to experiment for a while to find my niche, style, and audience. I also have to find the intersection of what I want to do naturally and what the people want, what's useful for them. If my intetion is to keep doing it for a long time, then this part is important.

## Daily 13 Coaches and Mentors



What's the difference? There was a discussion about this on WeekendClub slack that sparked the following thoughts. Here's my understanding as of now:

A mentor is someone who has traveled the path you're trying to go down. They are some miles ahead on the journey so they can share their knowledge, skills and experience. If you have a programming mentor, they teach and explain concepts, you can ask tactical questions about how to code something in a given language/framework. Similarly if you get a startup mentor, it'd be someone who has built and scaled a successful company before (even in your industry or with your business model (e.g. B2B)).

Coaches, on the other hand, help by listening with empathy, by asking you questions and guiding you to arrive at your own answers/solutions. This is applicable in helping your work through your own psychology, addressing limiting beliefs, etc. Coaches do not insert their opinions or suggestions into the conversation. They withhold judgement. Coaches need not have the skills you're trying to learn or need not have already done the thing you're trying to do.

I tried a coaching session few weeks ago, having never considered it before. It was interesting. I couldn't tell what the other person thought at all. She nodded and smiled and said mm..hm but had me do most of the talking. I went into this with a completely open mind. So I'll say it was interesting and I can see how this type of conversation can be useful.

There is another concept I like as far as people helping people make progress with their goals.

Thinking buddy - another person, a peer, who just listens to you think out loud. And you do the same for them. They may offer suggestions if it seems relevant to them. So unlike professional coaches who will refrain from offering their opinions/solutions, this arrangement has no rules. Do whatever is helpful to both people involved. This could also be called an accountability buddy, where you both meet and tell each other what you did and what you're planning to do. I think a mastermind is like this, but with 3 or 4 people not just 2. This can be about tactical advice, or about mindset stuff, or it can be general support.

Sometimes it helps to have someone else tell you that what you're thinking makes sense to them as well. I experienced this twice in the last week and it was helpful to hear both times.

Reminds of this line in the Billy Joel song, Vienna,

    Though you can see when you're wrong
    You know you can't always see when you're right

People need people. Each of the above can be helpful in different contexts and if you find the right person/arrangement. And sometimes, you just gotta be your own coach/buddy and keep on truckin

In addition to teaching/learning, one of my ATFM* goals is connecting. Enabling connections and collaboration among people, with the specific goal of learning from each other. Logistically I'm imagining doing this as some sort of a membership community for people who are passionate about teaching as well as learning. Exchanging knowledge. It could be anything from business skills to gardening to woodworking. People who know things deeply who want to share what they know with others. People who are curious and eager to learn, to become an apprentice. This'd be all for fun and for people to connect (without exchanging money per se for their time).

One specific example that solidified this idea in my mind - Miss R from R&C's school. One day during zoom school show-n-tell, she showed an avocado plant that she grew from avocado pits. I found this fascinating so I asked more questions and she went on to tell us in detail exactly how she does it, including transferring the plant to her backyard where it'll turn into a giant tree. She clearly seemed passionate about gardening. (I tried what she was describing. I couldn't get it to sprout. Would have loved to have a follow-up conversation about this and have her teach me more)

I have never connected with her outside of this. I know her husband passed away from cancer. She could be in this community and share her gardening skills many other eager learners like me (and maybe feel less alone). That was one thought.

What if I just start doing the things I care about (that I intended to do ATFM) now. Like now. I know I have romanticized some of these ideas in my head, so reality will be different. But it will be real.

ATFM = after the four million. Plans for how I envision spending my time after financial independence. Although if I'm setting aside this four million thing, maybe I can try incorporating these activities now. Just maybe. Why wait. What if I pretend I have that in the bank. Start spending my time the way I'd envisioned now. Such a cliche thing, deferring your "dreams", but I guess that's what I have been doing. And the money will follow? as I will need to make money somehow eventually. Have to have faith.  Commitment and faith.

## Daily 12 Something worth doing is worth doing it poorly



I read this on Twitter. And I immediately added 'at first' at the end of that sentence in my head. Worth doing poorly, at first right? because we all know something worth doing is worth doing well. But maybe the original sentence is better, no pressure.

In this context, I am thinking about creating teaching content, especially recorded content (e.g. screencasts).

There is so much tech content out there, tutorials, blog posts on every language, framework, and tool. I want mine to be good, not add to the noise. I want it to be clear and concise and... . High expectations I have of my teaching. That's a problem for taking action. So I'll stop that train of thought in it's track.

Instead I want to continue what I started earlier this year. Practice. Just Practice.

At the beginning of this year I did this 30 day challenge of recording myself every day. Just to improve at speaking clearly and confidently and slowly and not saying 'umm'. I hadn't ever recorded myself so it felt so unnatural to start. My only goal was to do it so it doesn't feel unnatural. I didn't have to share or publish this, that was not part of the challenge I made up for myself. (I had almost forgotten about this but now I'll think I'll go ahead and share it in WeekendClub, some of the essays might be interesting to others despite my audio rendition).
The Leaf Node
For makers/builders on a journey from employee to entrepreneur.
YouTube

Then, later in the year I recorded 15 screencasts in June/July. It didn't feel unnatural to do that. I recorded a short podcast of me talking to myself. Oof. That was cringe-worthy. But I am proud of myself of having it done it. Having started. Not only I created those things, this time I shared them openly too (emails to CodeCurious list, shared in WeekendClub, etc.) and people gave me feedback.

Those are steps in the right direction. How do I keep practicing this talking/recording skill?

Maybe I'll record audio versions of these daily writings. Maybe not all, but at least some, the ones that are more sharable (No Bhumi, no new commitments. Still do the 2 things I committed to for two more weeks before adding more).

I do want to get better at talking and recording myself and making screencasts. I deem this to be a worthwhile thing to do poorly. If I do it poorly for one whole year, I'll be proud of myself for practicing at least. (also this is needed for my future ATFM dreams, especially my mental models podcast and all my other podcast ideas. In addition to talking, listening+asking questions are also skills I want to practice).

## Daily 11 Begin with the end in mind is terrible advice

Someone recently asked me "So why do you want to start a business?" Simple question. My simple answer was "to make money". That doesn't quite cover it though. Everyone who starts a business does it to make money in some part. But there is more to it for me, like what for and how much?
I want to start a business to make the following amount of money for the following reasons. I wrote this down in a notebook 2 years ago, following one of the 7 habits "Begin with the end in mind"
Enough money in parent's bank account so that they do not have to think about money for the rest of their life/retirement. So for next 30 years let's say, they'll be in their 90's. I don't want them to think about the every day stuff like utility bills, property taxes, health insurance (stuff that medicare doesn't cover), home and car maintenance/repair. I also don't want to them to think twice about other bigger things like travel. I am estimating at $3k/month or $36K per year or 360K for 10 years and $1,080,000 for 30 years. This is not counting their current savings. I would really really like to put that 1.08 million dollars in parents bank account as soon as possible. Like in the next couple years or at least next 5 years. Because I want to maximize the number of years of life they have to be money worry free. Why? because they deserve it and that's just a fact (also they have never asked nor do they expect anything. They don't know I'm thinking this).
I would like to have funds set aside for R&C's education, college or whatever they decide to do. Estimating $50k/year --> $200k for 4 years * 2 = $400k for education.
I would also like to set aside travel funds to explore the world with family every summer. I want to expose R&C to different people, places, and perspectives. But this is also just for fun and because life is short and I miss my exploring days. So for numbers, let's say living in different places for 4 to 6 weeks every year. I imagine we can do this for the next 15 years before the kids move out and on with their own lives. So flights and accommodations will be variable but let's say $4000 for flights for 4 people and $200/day for living/food * 45 days = $9000. So $13k per year. For 15 years that $195,000 for family travel.
Financial independence so I can spend my time pursuing teaching and learning goals in a way that is independent of money. That's $2.25M of living expenses for remaining 45 years of life at estimated average annual expense rate. 
So that rounds out to $4M. That's the number that's been in my head. I don't consider myself a financially ambitious person. I don't want to make 100M or even 10M. 4 would do. And seemed doable, at the time I wrote down these numbers 2 years ago (based on the Indiehacker's interviews I had been consuming).
There is a bit of problem with lofty goals like these. You may think 'oh this person wants to make a million dollars to give to their parents'. That seems like a good reason. It would be hard for someone else to fault me for such a goal. But I think I can! As in
That's great Bhumi but you haven't even made a product that does $1000 MRR yet, like come on! 
[shaking myself by my own shoulders, if that's possible]
I have been carrying this in my mind for 2 years now. I rule out projects if they don't have the potential for $4M in revenue in some way. I do working backwards calculations like "If I want to sell a business for $4M, at 4x multiple I would need to make a product that can grow to $500,000 in annuel revenue. That's 42,000 MRR..." I have this index card pinned near my desk.

## Daily 10 Why we buy



Thinking about marketing mindsets today and why people buy things. I like this quote from Seth Godin, the I can offer you something you want part feels so powerful

and another one from Stacking The Bricks world

    This is what I need to hear today ⚡️ (and already have @alexhillman's book!) https://t.co/kzxbLkKukK
    — Bhumi (@bhumi1102) September 3, 2021

I like these quotes because they make me feel good about my lack of traditional marketing chops with funnels and CRO and growth hacking. Teaching you say, my brain's like I can do that!

The above quotes make it seem like I can do marketing without actually doing marketing. I just have be a human being who cares about making useful things and solving real problems by being empathetic to potential customers. That seems doable.

A friend recently shared a marketing newsletter he enjoys. I read the premise, what it advocates under the name of Emergent Marketing seems to resemble the above quotes and mindset. "The question we start with is: how can we make our marketing so valuable to our audience that they can’t help but be pulled forward and want to experience more?"

Anyway let's see if I can cross reference this marketing concept with my own experience as a customer. I'll go through an example purchase and see if I can pinpoint why I bought and what type of marketing was effective on me.

I bought this fitness program/course  2 years ago. It was 12-week self-paced thing, included pdfs, video demonstrations and a community. It was $57 then ($97 now).

I first came across this product from a youtube video. Which I'm now guessing was probably made as content marketing for the product targeting specific keywords.

Why I think I bought:

1. In the video, Jared talked about Transverse Abdominal (TVA) muscles, deepest muscles in the core. They are the ones that need to be rehabbed in order to re-strengthen the core after pregnancy. Rectus Abdominis, on the other hand, are the six pack muscles and working on those while the TVA is not stable is counter-productive. I cross-referenced this info and concluded that he knew what he was talking about. He had also listed a doctorate in physical therapy. Those credentials were less important than his ability to explain the theory and his approach.

2. The video also talked about the exercises you should not be doing and explained why (e.g. planks, sit-ups, push-ups, yoga poses all no good). Which opened my eyes and gave me a new insight.

3. The fact that his wife was is first customer.  The before and after picture of his wife among others. I liked that there was a progression of exercises.

Ultimately the main reason I bought is because I was already looking for something like it. For a long time. Over a year. And hadn't found anything that came close. It was targeting a specific problem (core rehab after pregnancy).

When I came across this product I had a strong hunch that it was something big.

In fact, the product was not perfect in terms of presentation and delivery. But it made sense and worked. There were things I didn't like about the product, but that didn't prevent me from buying.

I dislike the name. I didn't care for the landing page. It was one of those long scrolling infomercial type complete with "but wait there's more". I thought the delivery could have been done better (instead of sending PDFs over email and resending with revisions).

Ultimately, the product delivered the promised value. I remember recommending it to few others.

The reason I thought this product may be onto something is because it was filling a gap, addressing a real problem people search for. My hunch was right. When I did the program there were ~300 members in the community. Now, 2 years later, there are 4800 members. The Youtube channel had several thousand youtube subscribers I think, I just checked and now there are over a million subscribers!

In my product purchase example, there was definitely an element "I've been paying attention and I can offer you something you want". There was also teaching via the youtube videos. The fact that he could explain the anotomy and theory. Based on the details in the video I could verify that he knew what he was talking about and was speaking from experience.

## Daily 09 Copywriting fail?



The donation banner on Wikipedia made me think of this story I read in a marketing book couple years ago:

A large national park (in Arizona or something) was having a littering problems. They decided to run a campaign to combat this. They put up signs in the park that read something like "X thousand people visit the park daily and litter Y tons of garbage. Please don't litter".

That did not help much. In fact, the book claimed that it made the problem worse compared to having no sign at all.

Then they changed the sign to simply read "Please don't litter". And that did help compared to no sign.

The reason the first sign doesn't work is because it normalizes the behavior that it's trying to discourage. As in "it's no big deal if I litter a little bit, sounds like everyone else does it too"

I wish I remembered which book this was. Maybe Made To Stick? This was couple years ago. I read half a dozen marketing books on top of each other so it could be any one of them.

The point it's making about marketing copy is that it's better to spell out the action or behavior you're trying to encourage. Not the one you're trying to prevent or discourage.

Coming back to the Wikipedia donation banner I saw yesterday, my hunch is that it doesn't convert well...I can imagine it rubs people the wrong way and even feels a bit manipulative by making use of guilt.

Instead of this (with all the negative copy highlighted)

    Hi reader. This is the 4th time we've interrupted your reading recently, but 98% of our readers don't give; they keep reading. This Wednesday we ask you to protect Wikipedia's independence.

## Daily 08 On physical fitness

 want to be able to do squats and push-ups when I'm 85. Why? I first got this idea in my head when I saw Ruth Bader Ginsburg training with a personal trainer, doing exactly that at that age!  

The real reason why I suppose it that I value self reliance and want be mobile and independent when I'm old. My grandfather is turning 95 in 2 weeks. I have 3 grandparents over the age of 85. So I am going to assume I'm going to live that long. Genes and all. So it only makes sense to plan for it. Plan to keep this body functional, mobile, self-sufficient as long as I live, if I can help it.

So how do you do that? Be active, eat healthy, sleep enough. The usual basics right. But what's the minimum that I can practice sustainably.

A funny hack I thought of: If I do squats every day for the rest of my life – not many, just 10 or 15 – then I will automatically be able to them when I am 85!  Like your joints and muscles don't just stop working overnight right. If I can do my squat the day before my 85th birday, I'd be able to do them on my 85th birthday (kinda like a proof by induction). I know, genius right. So I did those squats, for a over a year (from March 2020 to June or July of 2021) but then I stopped for because..I can't remember exactly when or why. doh. plan fail.

But It's okay. I started up again couple weeks ago, let's see if I can keep it up until age 85 this time. [note to self: my writing needs some emojis]

Back to learning the minimum viable sustainable practice for longevity. In fall of 2019 I got really into reading and learning more about fitness stuff (and my very first "failed startup" had to do with fitness so I had an excuse too).

I read books like Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle by Tom Venuto, NASM Essentials of Personal Fitness Training. I got Delavier's Women's Strength Training Anatomy Workouts and followed the program and did those sets and reps each week. I learned more about strength training and muscle mass. I also became one of those people who ate protein bars regularly.

I learned this term healthspan – the amount of your life when you're physically fit and healthy. Lifespan, on the other hand, is just how many years you live. I decided I wanted my healthspan to be equal my lifespan.

Prior to then, I had never given exercise or physical fitness much thought (probably because I was in good shape, not intentionally but as a side effect) I happen to be active by doing things like hiking, rock climbing, playing badminton and ultimate frisbee. I did these things not to exercise or with fitness in mind, I had friends who did those things and it was simply a way for us to hang out. This was all BK (before kids). For about 4 years from 2015 to 2019 that all changed and now I had to find a way to exercise intentionally and I didn't have free time. Hence my interest in learning this stuff and finding the minimal sustainable practice.

In addition to reading stuff, coming up with my exercise routines, logging my macros nutrients and eating protein bars, I also talked to people in the fitness industry in early 2020. I cold emailed (before I knew that's what it was called) some personal trainers and physical therapists. I went to a few local gyms, did their health assessment and peppered the staff with questions to cross-reference stuff I was reading. Most gyms are focused on helping people with specific weight loss goals. They smiled when I talked about increasing my healthspan and my goal of longevity. No one replied to my cold emails except one. I did talk to one gym owner in San Francisco who used to be an engineer and had transitioned to fitness industry. That was a nice conversation. I also had a call with someone from Nerd Fitness after reading about them on Indie Hackers.

[add story about the 12 week core rehab program, and the habit tracker I built]

Ultimately I decided to not to pursue the fitness business idea in early 2020, around the start of the pandemic.

I kept doing my squats, sometimes added planks and push-ups. And I also walked 40 minutes and got my step counter app on my phone to be green every day. That was the basic level I could keep up with for over a year. (I stopped couple months ago as life got a bit stressful but I started again few weeks ago and it's been green since November 7.)

Physical fitness is definitely one of those long-term game that compounds. Small steps every day. Almost boring. And it's okay if you fall of the track, as long as you get back on.

My grandfather is relatively healthy for 95. I don't recall him ever being in a hospital for anything until recently. Here are the habits I know he followed:  

    He walked for 1 hour every morning for 50 years. From age 40 to age 90. I've also seen him to breath work and meditation.
    He fasted every Monday. Ate once a day, just lunch no dinner. In general, he had a rule about stopping eating when you're 90% full.
    He read and kept his mind active in general

I recently read a book called Blue Zones. It's lessons about living longer from some of the oldest people all over the world. Essentially what they mention in the book is not too different from how my grandparents live and habits I mentioned above.

No fancy workouts. Some daily low intensity steady state cardio with walking. Food in moderation and staying mentally active.

So maybe that's it. That's all there is to it.

## Daily 7 My fantasy SaaS idea



This SaaS idea has to do with books + reading + connecting people. I've had this idea for a while now. I don't think it's a good idea. The version I can imagine is a direct to consumer (B2C) app+community. It would be a nice-to-have product. Not an utility, not an immediate pain killer. For those reasons and for my lack of marketing/personal brand building chops (which I think this idea would require to attract enough customers for meaningful revenue), I don't think it's a good idea. It would probably fail.

Nevertheless I want to do the exercise of writing it all out, the vision, the dream, the fantasy. (partly inspired by this post - Amy's 7 hardass rules for life and rule #3)

    Dream your big dreams, but recognize that you’re unlikely to reach them for years and set them aside so they don’t distract you from the reality of today.

So here it goes!

The product/app

I write notes when I read books. Depending on the book, sometimes I write pages, sometimes just 1-2 paragraphs. I've done this for a long time. My notes are not in one place though - some are on my personal blog, some are on external sites, some are in my Evernotes and other newer note-taking apps. Most of them are handwritten notes in notebooks. In addition to notes, I also have tracking spreadsheets with book title, when I read it, and what I thought about it. I have this in Goodreads and Google Sheets and Notion.

I don't think I am the only one. I know other people also take notes and track books they read. So I can imagine building a single place to store of all this reading related info. (No I don't want to build a "better goodreads" or take on Amazon). I'm imagining a simple CRUD app, a glorified spreadsheet. Then optionally adding note-taking / uploading pics of handwritten note, etc. I can imagine many features, but keeping it super simple at first would be the way to go. And see if at least I could use it and enjoy using it.

That much sounds practical. Here's where the fantasy part comes in. I would keep this up and running forever. For the rest of my life at least. (I know Garry is running Posthaven blog like this and that idea has always appealed to me). If I read even 10 books a year in the next 50 years I'd have 500 books logged. I can imagine passing this on to my family (kids, grandkids?!). I would love to have something like this from my grandparent (age 95) who I know has been reading all of his life. This would not only be about me. I would enable my customers to have this experience of creating a log of their life in books and passing on a legacy to their family. So yeah.

This app isn't meant to be used as a vanity metric. It would have no social features. It would not encourage bragging about number of books read or rank members or have leader-boards, nothing like that. It would be about you and your life, it would be about depth of reading (connecting with others). It would be like your digital bookshelf, clicking on each book would display your notes and thoughts. Meant for yourself, as a way to follow your own journey and see what you thought and how you grew and learned along the way from books you read at a given time in your life. It is delightful to look at something I wrote or thought 2 years ago and think "wow what an idiot I was for thinking that". This reaction is good because that thought implies that I've grown in that time. Also if you reread a book, it would be interesting to compare your notes from the previous time and look for different takeaways.

The community

As far as the community part, it's another idea I've had for a long time (many years) I'll call Inverse bookclub. I often checkout books from the library and many times they are already in-use and I have to put a hold on it. I wonder who is this person reading the same book as me around the same time? Why did they decide to read this book? Why now? How did they come across it? What did they think of it? Did they recommend it to a friend? Did they get other book recommendations from reading that book?

So many questions, which I could ask, if I was in a community of book lovers. I would device some algorithm to match up people based having read the same book in the span of a couple months, to meet and discuss. So unlike an actual bookclub, where a group of friends get together first, follow some democratic process of book selection, then they simultaneously read the same book at the same speed and then meet to discuss. This works, I've been a couple bookclubs with friends that have lasted at least several months. Eventually it fizzles out though. It's hard to find books that match everyone's current taste and mood.

Hence the "inverse" part. We would turn this process on it's head. Read what you want, when you want. And if you like, find people who happen to have read the same thing to connect with and discuss.

I don't yet I have any community building chops. I am intimidated but also secretly intrigued by this skill. (Unlike personal branding and what not) Community building is something I can see myself learning and getting good at.

I can go on about how I'd get customers, how many would I need, what I think I could charge. But I'll it here for now.

P.S. I realize the above makes me sound like a big nerd. I'm okay with that :)

## Daily 6 Sharing your numbers



When trying to make founder friends on the Internet, learning about their context is important. People have different constraints and motivators in life that play a huge role in their thinking and business related decision making.

Below are some of the questions that I think are important. I wish there was a socially accepted protocol where we could skip right to exchanging such details. Especially when both people are open and believe in sharing in the interest of learning from each other's data points (But in reality it takes time to move beyond the surface-level conversations, especially to details having to do with money). But until we get to some real talk, we can't truly help each other or engage freely in advice giving/taking. At least I often feel like I can't if I don't know someone's full context.  

    How is your time structured. Are you working a day job? is this a side project? Is your aim to go full-time? Are you living of savings? etc.
    How much time did you spend on X (for example. "I grew my twitter to X followers in Y months?" how many hours per day or week did you spend writing tweets/engaging.)
    How much did you make from X project, revenue and profit.
    What is your runway, how much savings do you have?
    Number in the bank at which point you consider yourself financially interdependent? You know, what's your F-U number.
    Partner situation/married or what not (affects free time)
    If they have children or not (affects free time)
    What do they do for health insurance (in the U.S. this is a reason for a many to not go solo) 

I am happy to answer any of the above questions about me. In a 1-on-1 conversation, I'd be open and share with potential friends (Though I doubt I'd ever post such things publicly). On the other hand, I often err on the side of not asking personal questions and never want to seem like I'm prying.  During our Friday chat, my sister challenged this about me. She said often people are happy to share, actually want to share. You just have to ask some open ended questions and listen. I know she does this and is good at getting to know new people faster. And people seem to open up to her and share all kind of details, based on the stories she has told me. (This also jives with what Michele Hanson talks about in her book Deploy Empathy, in the context interviewing customers and getting them to share details about their process and problems).

When I was listening to IndieHacker's podcast interview with Justin Jackson, I specifically remember him mentioning that a friend showed him their bank account and how much money they were actually making from something. And that opened his eyes and informed some decision. This resonates. I'd be glad to have such friends, and share if it helps them with a data point. Helps them learn something from my experience or helps them make a decision.

A related thought: Being able to exchange candid feedback

The amazing thing about the human mind is how capable it is of coming up with, convincing itself of and believing in all kinds of bull sh*t. One of the most underrated things in life is friends who call you out on your bullsh*t. With all due kindness.

You have to really get to know someone to be able to do this though. And that takes time. The compounding and all, as it applies to relationships. Especially friendships. I think it's valuable for someone to challenge your thinking and your assumptions. Yet another reason to go beyond the surface-level banter and have real in-depth conversations about your values and goals and what you're trying to accomplish and why. I have this with some IRL friends. And as start to make more Internet friends, I'm thinking more about how to achieve this.

## Daily 5 Subtle art of not giving a 

you know what. I sampled the first 45 minutes of this audiobook while I was walking outside yesterday. Not for the content but because I was curious why it's popular. On my quest to understanding the essence of human nature more deeply, if something appeals to millions (8 million copies sold I just checked), I need to look into it.

I say not for the content because I find myself to be in the "converted" camp on this topic. There are a very few things I give a f*ck about in life (though I don't phrase it quite that way normally). The list of things I don't bother to give a f*ck about can fill the rest of this planet. I don't flinch if someone cuts me off while driving (small potatoes). Nor do I care about fame or status related things. Bigger stuff, that gives some people a lot of grief in life I imagine. My friend Stephanie once told me, one of the reasons she thinks we're friends is that I am "one of the most drama-free person" she knows. I remember that as one of the highest compliments.

So I was mostly curious about what I would think of this book. And my brain was looking forward to the exercise of hypothesizing what specific traits of human nature make this appealing to so many. Here's what I got from that first 45 minutes:

Two things.

    "Life is suffering" truth telling. I didn't expect the back story of Buddha and the essence of Buddhism philosophy to be covered in this book. I recognized where he was going immediately because of this Coursera class I took last summer for fun. My notes, in fact, say exactly this First Noble Truth = Life is Suffering. Including the part about how pain and suffering are an evolutionary feature, not a bug. There is something comforting about having a book tell you "It's okay and expected that you will suffer in life. Good things will happen to you if you accept the nature of suffering". My theory is people resonate with this type of directness and lack of sugar-coating and coddling found in other self-help books.
    Humor. I found myself laughing out loud a few times. Humor is one of those things that connects people and no one is immune to a good pun and subtle play on words (you know it's true, admit it!).  For someone who doesn't typically use that word in their vocabulary, I found the use of profanity well done for the most part. (It's like what Mrs. Erickson (my high school math teacher) said about Good Will Hunting. She shared that she liked the movie and when someone mentioned 'what about the cursing' I remember being surprised by her saying"it was tastefully done"). Also I think the excessive use of f*ck appeals to people. It's one of those primal thing.

So that's what I think so far – pain and suffering and humor. That's why this book is popular.

## Daily 4 On learning and teaching - my sparktest results



At the beginning of 2020, near the start of my indie journey, I found this thing called SparkTest from a person named Johnathan Fields. I reread my "type" results and I didn't connect it until now, but this probably planted the seed in my head to start formally mentoring/teaching programming.

The reason I am thinking about all this, is this idea of compounding and doing something, one thing, for a long time. I have been doing this side project of teaching/mentoring for a long time (~20 months). Why is that?

Well, I didn't start off with grand plans or by working out 20 steps ahead. I just started with one student (Nikolai, who was a truck driver learning to code and would sometime call into our meetings from inside an actual truck. That was inspiring, he was dedicated). And then kept going and going.

There were times I wanted to quit. Sometimes students wouldn't show up during the free period or had to process refunds for that person who wasted my time, failed show-up after confirming, rescheduling multiple days in a row. But there were other students who were committed. So I never did quit.

Maybe the real reason I haven't quit is because what I am doing is aligned with what I'm meant to be doing? (The SparkTest results below surely imply that) The only thing missing is, in addition to teaching, time for deep learning, studying, building just for the sake of it. (and the little thing of how to generate meaningful revenue. I don't know how to make real money this way.)  

Yes I understand that these "tests" that tell you your "type" are not real science. And they sure do use extremely flattering language that make you feel warm and fuzzy. But the things I highlighted below are...whoa (keanu reeves style, in every movie). They leave me speechless.

    Your Primary Sparketype reveals the essential nature or "driver" of the work you're here to do (whether it's the work you get paid to do, or not). When you do the work of your Primary Sparketype, you come alive with purpose and, fully-expressed in a healthy way, deepen into meaning, flow, connection and joy.

    As a Sage, teaching or "illuminating" is your call. You live to share ideas, knowledge and experiences with others in a way that lifts them up and leaves them changed. This doesn't mean, by the way, you call yourself a teacher, or work in a field where it is a part of your title or even job description. It's about the essential nature of work that lets you feel most alive, and you can do this in nearly any field or endeavor.

    That means, of course, that you have to know something before you can teach it. So, you regularly seek to learn and study, you may even pour yourself into solving big problems or making things, and there is a certain genuine satisfaction in that. But, if you're really being honest, you do these things, in no small part, because you want to have more and better wisdom to turn around and teach. They're more a means to the end of being extraordinary at sharing wisdom in a way that leaves people better.

    When you see the lights of discovery go on in the faces of others, it's magic. But, for you, it's not enough to simply "convey information," you want those you teach or mentor to truly "get it," and you want to be engaged and inspired at every step along the way. It's about the process as much as the awakening. So you work tirelessly and with a sense of mission to find ways to share what you know that create genuine understanding and bring students, mentees, colleagues on a journey of discovery along with you. This is what makes you wake up in the morning.

    Your Shadow Sparketype is The Maven, which means you latch onto a topic, field or industry and devour everything you can know about it. Staying "surface level" just isn't an option for you. It's no fun. You are driven to learn, to discover, to ferret out information, wisdom and knowledge. But, for you, when you're really being honest, that drive is almost always in service of doing the work of your Primary Sparketype at the higher possible level. It's more a means than an end.

## Daily 3 Burnout? I'm not sure I know what that is



I am pretty sure before 2019, I never heard anyone around me use the word burnout.  And I hear this all the time now. Before 2019 I was not working on the Internet (had never posted on Twitter, etc.). I was living a mostly offline life.

Now I am surrounded by entrepreneurs and creators and otherwise independent people who make their own rules and earn a living on their own terms. I don't know if that has something to do with it.

Either way I really want to understand what people actually mean when they say "I'm dealing with burnout". I really do. Because I don't think I've experienced "burnout" in recent memory.

First I'll share what I understand burnout to be based on hearing people's burnout stories around the Internet. Some of my understanding was confirmed by this podcast episode. But I also realized some brand new things.

Initially, I thought it was just something people say. It almost seemed like a fashionable trendy thing to say (that's not very nice, I know, sorry!). And I imagine there are people who use burnout as a catch-all and confound it with other more (or less) serious mental states. But I've come to understand that burnout is a real and serious thing (It's just not something I have the propensity to experience).

Here's what I think burnout means:

You're doing work that you actually like and enjoy. But at some point, you end up over doing it which ultimately leads to you no longer being able to enjoy it. And also you feel like you can't stop or do less. It's kind of like overdosing on cake/cookies/candy (for people who like sugar, I don't really have a sweet tooth). If you eat as much as you possibly can, at some point you are going not enjoy it and feel unwell. I can imagine this happens when you're super ambitious or when you just can't draw boundaries and work fills up all of your time.

It seems people experience burnout after they have pushed themselves on a demanding and challenging project. For example after writing and launching a book or after running a time-intensive cohort based course.

This is what I gather burnout look like. I don't know though. Because I don't think I've ever experienced burnout. But I do find myself struggling with almost the opposite of that. I am going to call this state "holdout"

No Burnout but I struggle with 'holdout'

Part of what I mean by 'holdout' is that I hold myself back from starting certain projects or pull back quickly if I foresee the project interfering with my current life balance (specifically relationships with spouse/parents/sister or with my daily attention/patience reserve needed for parenting. My overall mental health or even physical health in terms of sleep and time to cook/enjoy food, etc.). I have no problem drawing boundaries and keeping things in perspective.

That sounds great right. To someone experiencing burnout I imagine it does. But there is a downside, a cost.

I feel like I don't have anything to show for my time over the last year. I've shipped small projects and attempted or explored many of my ideas. But nothing impressive (to me). I believe this is partly because I haven't gone far enough or long enough on any one thing yet. And I wonder now if pushing myself to a state close to burnout is necessary to have some meaningful success. At least that's what I see around me.  

The more immediate thing I want to figure out is this:

Currently I don't feel like I would enjoy my time if I were to take an actual vacation. Because I haven't done enough yet. My brain is like time away from what!? There are times when I am not physically working, but my brain is always doing meta work - this constant analyzing, evaluating, trying to figure out a path to travel. I don't feel fully present. And that is a problem. I fully recognize this. And my current priority is to figure what I need to do feel like I've done enough in a day or a week. To feel like I deserve some break or time off.

Here's what I'm thinking so far. The feeling I'm looking for is this. It's the feeling of enjoying a big lunch after a long strenuous morning hike or a challenging workout. It's enjoying something and thinking "I deserve this, I've worked hard for it". I want be heads down on a project, to launch or ship something (ideally something that resonates with others, that's useful and valuable to others). Instead of holding myself back, push myself to get to some meaningful milestone and then plan a break. A well-deserved break. And enjoy it.

## Daily 2 How to get rich without getting lucky



Below are some words (copied from a twitter thread) from someone who appears to be wise and accomplished in business*. This writing seems to have resonated with a lot of people and I am going to use these words as a springboard to document my current thoughts on wealth and work.

Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.

I deeply believe this. Especially for relationships and knowledge. And I've experienced the benefits of actual compound interest from savings/investing. I am trying to figure out what this means for me in the context of entrepreneurial work.

I can imagine how this applies to content creators. If you publish a newsletter, a podcast, or blog posts consistently for a year, I imagine you get a return on that investment in some way. It may be in the form of making new friends, or even new customers and clients. I imagine this. I haven't experienced this directly. I haven't published anything consistently for that long (yet).

Code and media are permissionless leverage. They're the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep.

The permissionless part is so true with code. When I was working as an employee, I've always felt that more of my software developer teammates should realize this and feel empowered. No one can stop you from writing some code, you don't have to ask permission. If you think something can be improved, go ahead create a branch, make the code changes and share the diff to get thoughts from your colleagues. Within an existing business, I can see how code being a permissionless leverage can be true. But for building a brand new business, this can be tricky. If you want paying customers, you need to solve a frequent painful problem in a large enough market. You don't need to ask permission from your potential customers to start writing code per se, but we know "build it and they'll come" also doesn't work.

The quote above says "media" is also a permissionless leverage. Media I guess means writing, podcasts, videos and such. This feels true. You don't have to ask permission to create. And there will be some subset of people with whom your work will resonate, because, well, you are both human.  

Unless you have a paid newsletter, I don't see how you make money from media though. I guess there are sponsorships and advertisements. But those things feel indirect (and also not aligned with my style..hm). I guess the idea is you build an 'audience' and create an email list with the content over time and eventually create products/services that are paid.

This last point meshes well with the other point about doing work that compounds and "play long term games with long term people"

More to think through from this thread, especially about "specific knowledge". More on that tomorrow.

Naval@naval·May 31, 2018

Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy.

Understand that ethical wealth creation is possible. If you secretly despise wealth, it will elude you.

Ignore people playing status games. They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games.

You’re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity - a piece of a business - to gain your financial freedom.

You will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not yet know how to get. At scale.

Pick an industry where you can play long term games with long term people.

The Internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers. Most people haven't figured this out yet.

Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.

Pick business partners with high intelligence, energy, and, above all, integrity.

Don't partner with cynics and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling.

Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.

Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage.

Specific knowledge is knowledge that you cannot be trained for. If society can train you, it can train someone else, and replace you.

Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now.

Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you but will look like work to others.

When specific knowledge is taught, it’s through apprenticeships, not schools.

Specific knowledge is often highly technical or creative. It cannot be outsourced or automated.

Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage.

The most accountable people have singular, public, and risky brands: Oprah, Trump, Kanye, Elon.

“Give me a lever long enough, and a place to stand, and I will move the earth.” - Archimedes

Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people, and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media).

Capital means money. To raise money, apply your specific knowledge, with accountability, and show resulting good judgment.

Labor means people working for you. It's the oldest and most fought-over form of leverage. Labor leverage will impress your parents, but don’t waste your life chasing it.

Capital and labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you.

Code and media are permissionless leverage. They're the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep.

An army of robots is freely available - it's just packed in data centers for heat and space efficiency. Use it.

If you can't code, write books and blogs, record videos and podcasts.

Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgement.

Judgement requires experience, but can be built faster by learning foundational skills.

There is no skill called “business.” Avoid business magazines and business classes.

## Daily 1 



I figured out these two qualities I want to have in the type of work I really really want to do: sharable and compoundable.

What I mean by compoundable is that I want to do work that builds on itself. Work that accumulates to something larger over time. Like if I can manage to put a few drops in every day, soon enough I"ll have a bucket of water and some day even a lake (or some larger body of water).

Writing is one example of work like that. If I spend 1 hour writing every day. I will have written hundreds of posts over the course of a few months and definitely many more in a few years.

Coding is not always like that. If I code for 1 hours every day, it may not amount to much (unless I'm tending to an existing Codebase and improving things by adding incremental features or pulling out weeds by refactoring and removing cruft). But the reality is that you cannot build a new product by coding 1 hour a day for a year. Building a product is a project work not ongoing work (such as writing daily).

It makes sense for me to separate these two types of work. Because (due to my current constraints in life and time) there are weeks or even months, where I only have 2 to 3 hours a day of total work block. All my other time is called for. During such time, I've noticed that the thing that keeps me motivated is doing work that is sharableable and compoundable. I know that if I spend two hours reading or writing or learning and logging something, I'll have something to show for my time.

I figured out that this is super important to me. Spending two hours figuring out Shopify admin API and constructing the right GraphQL query that allows me to apply discounts and change product prices programmatically is good (and I enjoy my time lost in the weeds of this stuff). But this is just one piece of the puzzle towards building a Shopify App. It is nothing I can share on its own.

What I mean by shareable work is work that I can point to at a future time and feel like I have something to show for my time. This is what I figured out after struggling with my plans falling through over the last 3 weeks.

I am reading and sharing book notes every week. And I am returning to daily writing. This does not feel like enough tbh. But I am starting here. A third thing I am looking to add once I've done the above two for a few weeks consistently, is making coding screencasts of tech I learn along the way to building my product(s).
