title:  "PodNotes 02: Process of Making a SaaS Business Work (IH#145)"
---

This interviewed aired on January 20, 2020 with Jane Portman of Userlist. I listened to it shortly after. These are my notes and takeaways as they apply to my current place on the journey.

Starting your bootstrapping journey with a SaaS product seems like the default choice, especially for developers. But in reality there are a number of steps that could come before that - from freelancing/consulting to building your expertise while building your audience, to launching info products and productizing your services. Jane did all of that.

👩‍💻 📖 April Dunford, Product Positioning - they did the exercises in the book to figure how to talk about Userlist.

👩‍💻 👨‍💻 Amy Hoy and Alex Hillman - Stacking the Bricks philosophy, sale safari approach, all about building a useful product that solves a user's pain.

👨‍💻 📖 Nathan Berry, book Authority about teaching what you know, how to write a book

💡Selling pain killers vs. vitamins - high motivation, must have vs. nice to have / preventive.

🤣 The art of H1 is having a header on your landing page that really captures what you are about. It's like the elevator pitch for a SaaS business.

💡Writing about what you're building while you're doing it is a great way to do marketing. Working in public helps you and your potential customers. (context: Jane said this was possible because they had 3 founders and one of them could focus on this effort.)

Jane's advice for someone just starting out - start smaller. Info product experience is good. Existing category is easier. Build something and go through the entire process.
